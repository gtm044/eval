The group’s debut recording of Drumming is scheduled for release this season. Currie has recorded many concertos, solos and chamber works, including most recently works by Elliott Carter (Ondine) and Simon Holt (NMC). His recording of Rautavaara’s Incantations with the Helsinki Philharmonic and John Storgårds (Ondine) won a 2012 Gramophone Award, and his recording of Jennifer Higdon’s Percussion Concerto with the London Philharmonic and Marin Alsop won a 2010 Grammy Award.\\nColin Currie plays Zildjan cymbals and is a MarimbaOne Artist.

Gnanavel Raja studio Green films bankrolled this movie, which happens to be a remake of superhit Hindi movie Special 26. The album has 5 songs based on different genres.\\nNaana Thana\\nSingers: Anirudh\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nIt\\'s a complete song that takes you through the exciting phase of of moments in love. The lyrics has purity with a peak of playfulness boy\\'s perspective. In fact the song has already been a favourite of town people from the time it was launched as a single track. There is a lot of energy in the song right on the first second and the musical components or so much invigorating to the senses. Anirudh has picked the style of that Hindi stage performance where the fill-ins with harmonium and vocalism are evident.\\nSodakku\\nSingers: Antony Dasan\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThe song needs no introduction as it has already through to be a strong winner in the charts. The song has highly enthusiastic appeal from musical team. On a precise note, this happens to be the first ever fast paced folk song for Suriya in the recent times. The high level energy pumping percussion and unparalleled rendition by Antony Dasan makes the song more enjoyable. Not to miss the interludes that comes with fast running notes on Veena, which is exotically unparalleled.\\nThaana Serndha Koottam\\nSingers: Anirudh and Vignesh Shivn\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThe song has lots of values on the lyrical part and it looks like this would be placed during a crucial moment of the movie. The distorted guitar on the backdrops along with the rhythmic accompaniment add more sense to the peppiness. The kind of rendition by both Anirudh and Vignesh belong to a unique panache. This could get more prominence with the visual presentation of the song.\\nEngae Endru Povadhu\\nSingers: Anirudh and Shakthishree Gopalan\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThere are certain times, where a particular song manages to get beyond the premise of a movie and touch us unconditionally. It is decided by the theme of the song, the lyrical Phrases and of course the musical presentation that would imbibe to our senses. This song brings out such traits in a great way that the song instantly appeals to our attention. The lyrical lines are so much simple and yet compelling that was down a lot of emotions. Anirudh has always been a master of such musical style and it just enables the song to get propelled to a greater stroke.\\nPeela Peela\\nSingers: Jassie Gift, Nakash Aziz and Mali\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nInnovative lyrics and fun filled music makes the song click well at the very initial level you start listening to it. As known to many, TSK is set in the time period of 80s and henceforth, the lyrical words used in the song that includes Ujala, Rasna and few more terms that were prominent during those times gets us connected easily.\\nOn the whole, Thaana Serndha Koottam delivers a decent package of music that will definitely be the best in the careers of Suriya, Vignesh Shivn and Anirudh respectively. The songs have the best feel of high energy, emotions, fun, joy and everything that it needs to impress listeners.\\nVerdict : Suriya-Anirudh-Vignesh Shivn trio sparkle in this Chartbuster with great music.\\n#ThaanaSerndhaKoottam #VigneshShivn #Suriya #KeerthySuresh #studioGreen #Anirudh #ThaanaSerndhaKoottamMusicReview\\nHowever been one of the top heroines in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, Keerthy Suresh has been well...\\nDirected by ‘Uriyadi’ fame Director Vijay Kumar and bankrolled by himself under the banner of...\\nProduced under the grand banner of ‘Lyca Productions’, the shooting of K V Anand’s directorial...<break>CURRENTLY SOLD OUT\\nGisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths by Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, Rebecca Duclos (Hard book explores twenty-five years of work from contemporary artist Gisele Amantea. Gisele Amantea\\'s twenty-five year career features in a stunning new hardcover volume. Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea\\'s installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea\\'s career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist\\'s current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.\\n- Author BiographyEve-Lyne Beaudry is curator of contemporary art at the Musee d\\'Art de Joliette.

Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.\\nOn Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth\\'s system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA\\'s Earth Science Division.\\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\\nIn Earth\\'s orbit, the satellites\\' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\\nRuf, the project\\'s principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we\\'ll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\\n\"There\\'s several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\\nRuf added that the satellites\\' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it\\'s been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn\\'t been done before, according to Ruf.\\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that\\'s a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there\\'s been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it\\'s a measurement that we don\\'t have globally but it\\'s using technology that we don\\'t have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We\\'ve had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.'}, {'question': 'Who were the four students of the University of Port Harcourt that were allegedly murdered?', 'answer': 'The four students of the University of Port Harcourt that were allegedly murdered were Chiadika Lordson, Ugonna Kelechi Obusor, Mike Lloyd Toku and Tekena Elkanah.', 'response': 'Chiadika Lordson, Ugonna Kelechi Obusor, Mike Lloyd Toku, and Tekena Elkanah.', 'reference_context': 'Port Harcourt – The Rivers police command on Wednesday arraigned 13 suspects before a Port Harcourt Magistrates’ Court charged with conspiracy and murder of four students of the University of Port Harcourt.\\nThe suspects were arraigned on a five-count charge of murder, felony, conspiracy, lynching, and burning.\\nProsecuting police Adiari Idafi told the court, presided over by Magistrate Emma Woke, that the accused on Oct. 5, allegedly murdered Chiadika Lordson, Ugonna Kelechi Obusor, Mike Lloyd Toku and Tekena Elkanah.\\nIdafi named the accused as Hassan Welewa, 59 (Male), Lawal Segun, 28 (Male), Lucky Orji, 43 (Male), Cynthia Chinwo, 24 (Female), Ekpe Daniel, 30 (Male).\\nOthers are George Nwadei, 20 (Male), Gabriel Oche, 33 (Male) Ozioma Abajuo, 23 (Male), Chigozie Evans Samuel, 22 (Male), Endurance Edet, 27 (Male), and Endurance Okoghiroh, 24 (Male).\\nAlso arraigned were David Chinasa Ugbaje, 30 (Male) and Ikechukwu Louis Amadi, alias Kapoon, 32 (Male).\\nIdafi stated that the offence was punishable under Section 324 of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Laws of River State, Nigeria, 1999, and Section 319 of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Vol. III laws of Rivers State, Nigeria, 1999.\\nThe accused were asked by the court if they understood the charges and they consented, but no pleas were taken.\\nThe magistrate ordered that the accused be remained in police custody for further investigation, and adjourned the case till Dec. 20, for further hearing.

Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it\\'s Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\\nSA = Sexual Assault\\nST = Sex Trafficking\\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\\n*Children’s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\\n*DV Community Education – 1989,\\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney’s Office 1992 to 2002,\\n*Crisis Intervention Team. Asha Advocates and District 5 City of Milwaukee Police Officers team up to respond to DV crime scenes to provide enhanced and immediate victim services 1995-97\\n*Ujima Men’s Program 1994, a non-traditional abuser treatment program culturally specific to African American men who abuse and batter women.\\n*State licensed Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Clinic-1995-2012\\n*Healthy Beginnings Project (Black Health Coalition of WI) Asha DV/SA, substance abuse and mental health counselor see pregnant women in Milwaukee County Jail-1995-2005.\\n*HIV and STD testing, treatment and prevention – 1999-2011 State of WI\\n*Transitional Housing for women released from Prison-2006 to 2010,\\n*Transitional Housing (long-term) for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Dating Violence and their children who are homeless due to victimization-2007-2010,\\n*Employment training and skill building. Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected.

Having sold 10.8 million copies, it\\'s the 14th-best-selling album in the history of SoundScan. But sales figures aside, it was Em stepping into the prime of his career. It was a lightning rod for controversy in the year 2000 when CD sales hit their all time peak. At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like \\'N Sync and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it—culminating when he performed \"Stan\" at the 2001 Grammys alongside Elton John. But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist.\\nIn many ways, MMLP picked up where his previous album, The Slim Shady LP, left off—many of the new songs mirrorred older ones. There\\'s another \"Public Service Announcement\" (once again voiced by Jeff Bass of The Bass Brothers), Em calls \"Drug Ballad\" his \"love song\" the way he called \"Cum On Everybody\" his \"dance song,\" and the \"holy-shit-this-guy-is-out-of-his-fucking-mind-but-also-amazing\" song \"Kim\" is a prequel to \"\\'97 Bonnie & Clyde.\"\\nThe brutal honesty and specific clarity in the rhymes was striking, but Em\\'s anger is the hallmark of this album. This is roll-your-windows-down, turn-your-system-up, throw-up-your-middle-finger-and-let-it-linger-music.\\nUnlike his debut, however, the album got past being seen as silly or cheesy. In 1999, we didn\\'t know what to make of this angry blonde dude because it was hard to tell when the jokes started and ended. In 2000, things became clearer as he delved further into autobiographical territory. We started to hear the seriousness in the stories about how he used to get \"beat up, peed on, be on free lunch, and changed school every three months.\"\\nThe album sounded different too. While Dr. Dre provided only three beats The Slim Shady LP, here, he and his partner Mel-Man handled most of the first half of the album, with Eminem and The Bass Brothers taking over for most of the second. Even when it came to the production credits, duality remained a running theme for Eminem (or is that Slim Shady?)\\nThe brutal honesty and specific clarity in the rhymes was striking, but Em\\'s anger is the hallmark of this album. This is roll-your-windows-down, turn-your-system-up, throw-up-your-middle-finger-and-let-it-linger-music. Em\\'s words are so precise and he\\'s so in control of his pen, yet he\\'s so emotionally erratic. (Maybe a lasting effect of his infamous Amsterdam acid trip, upon which he claims he wrote so much of the album that he considered calling it Amsterdam.)\\nHe rages against everyone; past tormentors, magazines that made fun of him (\"Double-XL, Double-XL!\"), his mother, his wife, and even manages to aim an AK at Dre\\'s face, just because. But he\\'s so damn good at it you hardly want to hear anyone else rapping. There isn\\'t a long guest list, but every voice other than Em\\'s feels like a distraction you want to fast-forward past. How could we listen to anyone else when Em was spontaneously combusting before our very ears? The rage was magnetic, hypnotic. \"Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts!\"!!\"\\nThe anger spews in every direction as he takes reckless shots at pop culture\\'s other famous figures. Maybe because Em was still a battle rapper at heart, one in need of a bullseye to aim his verbal darts at. He spends a lot of time lashing out at his critics, too.!!\" Lines from \"Criminal\" like \"Hate fags? The answer\\'s yes\" are way too literal for a rapper so obsessed with weaving such an intricate web of humor and horror. And there are always lines he won\\'t cross. One verse later he rhymes \"I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker/Than you\\'d wanna fuck me up for saying the word...\" He stops there. There\\'s still one word out there that even Eminem won\\'t say.\\nDespite the album\\'s artistry and massive success, in a weird way, it\\'s hard to call it an \"influential\" album. Sure, there are lots of white rappers today and Em certainly inspired part of that, but all of them shy away from Em comparisons. And none of them—stylistically, musically, and definitely lyrically—can hold a candle to Eminem at his peak. Really, no one of any race can compare.\\nBar for bar, line for line, Eminem is and always will be a rapper\\'s rapper. But this isn\\'t the typical \"rap\" album, it\\'s so far removed from hip-hop\\'s sonic center and typical subject matter. It\\'s an Eminem album, and this is when Eminem became EMINEM. And Eminem isn\\'t your regular rapper, not your regular pop star. He\\'s what he\\'s shown to be on the back cover of the album, a freak genius who likes to write raps. There he sits, Marshall, and he sits alone. —Insanul AhmedHOUSTON (Jan. 23, 2018) – Fabien Gabel, music director of the Quebec Symphony Orchestra, returns to Houston to lead the Houston Symphony in Ravel’s Daphnis and Chloé on Feb. 2 and 3 at 8 p.m. and Feb. 4 at 2:30 p.m. in Jones Hall.\\nRecognized internationally as one of the stars of the new generation, Fabien Gabel is a regular guest of the Houston Symphony and an audience favorite.

From his earliest years Currie forged a pioneering path in commissioning and creating new music for percussion. In recognition of this commitment, he received the Royal Philharmonic Society Young Artist Award in 2000, a Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award in 2005 and the Royal Philharmonic Society Instrumentalist Award in 2015. Currie has premiered works. Currie’s 2017-18 season includes premieres of works by Andy Akiho, Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Brett Dean, Joe Duddell and Dave Maric. In the coming seasons Currie will premiere works by Helen Grime and Simon Holt.\\nCurrie currently serves as Artist in Association at London’s Southbank Centre, where he was the focus of a major percussion festival in 2014, and this season Currie completes his three year term as Artist in Residence with the Oregon Symphony Orchestra. The 2017-18 season also features a series of solo recitals at the Schubert Club, Budapest’s Liszt Academy, Lawrence University and Sir James MacMillan’s The Cumnock Tryst Music Festival. Orchestral engagements include performances here and with the Antwerp Symphony, BBC Philharmonic, Het Gelders Orkest, National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Scottish Chamber and Brno Contemporary Orchestras.\\nCurrie’s ensemble the Colin Currie Group was formed in 2006 to celebrate the music of Steve Reich and made its five-star debut at the BBC Proms.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients\\' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company\\'s technology and prevent others from infringing it;<break>Beliveau Estate\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\\n- 855-516-1090\\nAbout The Hotel\\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\\nFEATURED\\nAMENITIES\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\\nHotel Location\\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\\nTraveler Sentiments\\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\\nHelpful Info & FAQs\\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities'}, {'question': 'What are the main agricultural products that African countries export to the rest of the world?', 'answer': 'African countries mainly export cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea, and vegetables to the rest of the world.', 'response': 'The main agricultural products that African countries export to the rest of the world are cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea, and vegetables.', 'reference_context': 'The crazy level at which African countries import things was reiterated by the president of Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, while addressing the delegates at the Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU) annual meeting in Victoria Falls.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers\\' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service<break>Clean tidy house with wonderful ocean views.

Where the Wimmenz Are.\\nA survey of Catholics in Germany and Switzerland shows that most reject the church\\'s teachings on contraception, divorce, sexual morality and gay unions. This will not change the moral teachings of the church.\\nWell, of course not, and not only because the results might be different elsewhere in the world.\\nAnd despite some statements by pope Francis, neither is much going to change in the official teachings of the church about the proper place of women*, though it could well be the case that your average Catholic in this country or in Germany or Switzerland might not agree with those teachings, either.\\nI have written before about the three pillars on which the general second-class status of women depend** (religion, laws and science/pseudoscience). Out of the three it is religion which is the hardest and the slowest to change, because the holy books, written when cultures were very patriarchal, can always be interpreted as the written law of god. Once someone does that, well, you are arguing with a divine power.\\nThis doesn\\'t mean that religions cannot change or that there aren\\'t religions which have changed. Some do wonderful work on women and gender. But there\\'s a lot of work still to be done within the three large Abrahamic religions***.\\n-------\\n*The teachings about contraception, sexual morality, divorce and gay unions are also linked to the proper place of women, of course.\\n**I use the pillars metaphor on purpose, because the old argument often consist of both restricting women\\'s roles in the society and of putting them on a partial pedestal, especially as mothers. You can\\'t leap off the pedestal without getting hurt but on the other hand your specific female talents (which the current pope attributes to women) can be more easily worshiped that way.\\n***And probably in other religions, too..'}, {'question': 'What is the main goal of the CHI 2011 workshop on large interactive displays in public urban contexts?', 'answer': 'The main goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area.', 'response': 'The main goal of the CHI 2011 workshop on large interactive displays in public urban contexts is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area.

However I’ve just come across Roxanne Millar’s book ‘The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus’.\\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\\n- SAFe [SAFe].\\nSAFe describes NFRs as “persistent qualities and constraints”.\\nMany NFRs begin their lives as ‘Enablers’ that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 – Responding to Cohn’s post] proposes an alternative format:\\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of ‘Supplementary Requirements’ listing all NFRs.\\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the ‘SAFe Requirements model’ presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb’s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don’t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example – see [SAFe].\\nGilb says:\\n“…it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts”. “Quality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable”.\\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued – See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb’s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler’s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\\nConclusion\\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\\nReferences:\\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing – Gabrielle Benefield\\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\\n- [Gilb] What’s Wrong With Agile Methods –Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification – Gilb & Brodie 2007\\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract<break>I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security. As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.\\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:\\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\\nThe last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:\\n- How to make a backup?\\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.\\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\\nThe books is available online here.\\nProfile<break>In 1971, NASA sent three astronauts who were University alumni to the moon as part of the Apollo 15 lunar mission. Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.\\nOn Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth\\'s system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA\\'s Earth Science Division.\\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\\nIn Earth\\'s orbit, the satellites\\' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\\nRuf, the project\\'s principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we\\'ll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\\n\"There\\'s several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\\nRuf added that the satellites\\' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it\\'s been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn\\'t been done before, according to Ruf.\\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that\\'s a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there\\'s been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it\\'s a measurement that we don\\'t have globally but it\\'s using technology that we don\\'t have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We\\'ve had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions.

Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it's Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\\nSA = Sexual Assault\\nST = Sex Trafficking\\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\\n*Children’s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\\n*DV Community Education – 1989,\\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney’s Office 1992 to 2002,\\n*Crisis Intervention Team.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service<break>.34.

Hear him: ‘it is regrettable that African countries spend between $30 billion and $50billion annually on imports of agricultural products, instead of developing the productive capacities necessary for trade’.\\nAccording to the United Nations’ 2015 World Population Prospect Report, 2.4 billion people are projected to be added to the global population between 2015 and 2050, with 1.3 billion in Africa alone. Which means by 2050, Africa will house more than half of the world’s population and as at now no preparation is being made on how it will feed its 1.3 billion population by 2050. What about the now? 2050 is still some years ahead; what are the African leaders doing to stop, or at least, reduce the importation of finished agricultural products. Currently, Africa is still unable to feed itself and depends on importation of products to feed its people. What will happen by 2050, if a stop is not put to this trend?\\nThe potential for growth in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa is well understood, but has not been realised. Currently, the agro-allied industry (in primary processing) accounts for nearly half of all economic the activity in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the continent spends $30bn to $50bn each year importing food and still has significant food risk and nutritional deficiencies in many parts of the region. This is despite the fact that the continent holds much of the world’s potential agricultural land (Africa has 65% of the world arable land).\\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN FAO), Africa spends $35 billion in importing food, and it is projected that the number will grow to $110 billion by 2025. Africa is importing what it should be producing, creating poverty within the region and consequently creating jobs for the people in other continents while its people lack opportunities.\\nIt is interesting to note that African countries import numerous agricultural products which are also, ironically, produced locally. The rise of imports for these Agricultural products has been attributed to the inability to produce enough to satisfy growing local demand, due to low yields and relatively low levels of productivity. Furthermore, over 80% of Africa’s agricultural products are being produced by smallholder farmers who produce 70% of the continent’s food supply, according to FAO.\\nTaking a look at Agricultural exports, one discovers that African countries mainly export cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea and vegetables to the rest of the world. The main agricultural importing countries of the African export are the United States, China, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\\nAfrican countries do not feature under the top supplying countries for any of these markets. If Africa is serious about changing from agricultural product importers, then addressing the following issues are of paramount importance: innovation in production technology, the cost of inputs (energy and fertilisers), management of changes in climatic conditions (e.g. access to water through irrigation), knowledge transfer and capacity building, investment in agriculture and agriculture-related infrastructure (credit facilities, transportation networks, cold-storage facilities and communication networks) and access to information.\\nALSO READ: Questions on Nigeria’s 2017 Budget\\nGovernments and leaders in Africa (past and present) should (have) know(n) in importing food is a serious minus for the leadership of the component countries in Africa.\\nAgriculture is also a major component for Africa becoming an industrialised continent, in the sense that its raw materials are needed in production of other commodities. Africa has come of age and its agricultural practices should be driven by research, mechanisation and modern technology to steer it away from remaining rudimentary.\\nBecoming.

The lyrics has purity with a peak of playfulness boy's perspective. In fact the song has already been a favourite of town people from the time it was launched as a single track. There is a lot of energy in the song right on the first second and the musical components or so much invigorating to the senses. Anirudh has picked the style of that Hindi stage performance where the fill-ins with harmonium and vocalism are evident.\\nSodakku\\nSingers: Antony Dasan\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThe song needs no introduction as it has already through to be a strong winner in the charts. The song has highly enthusiastic appeal from musical team. On a precise note, this happens to be the first ever fast paced folk song for Suriya in the recent times. The high level energy pumping percussion and unparalleled rendition by Antony Dasan makes the song more enjoyable. Not to miss the interludes that comes with fast running notes on Veena, which is exotically unparalleled.\\nThaana Serndha Koottam\\nSingers: Anirudh and Vignesh Shivn\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThe song has lots of values on the lyrical part and it looks like this would be placed during a crucial moment of the movie. The distorted guitar on the backdrops along with the rhythmic accompaniment add more sense to the peppiness. The kind of rendition by both Anirudh and Vignesh belong to a unique panache. This could get more prominence with the visual presentation of the song.\\nEngae Endru Povadhu\\nSingers: Anirudh and Shakthishree Gopalan\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThere are certain times, where a particular song manages to get beyond the premise of a movie and touch us unconditionally.

This song brings out such traits in a great way that the song instantly appeals to our attention. The lyrical lines are so much simple and yet compelling that was down a lot of emotions. Anirudh has always been a master of such musical style and it just enables the song to get propelled to a greater stroke.\\nPeela Peela\\nSingers: Jassie Gift, Nakash Aziz and Mali\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nInnovative lyrics and fun filled music makes the song click well at the very initial level you start listening to it. As known to many, TSK is set in the time period of 80s and henceforth, the lyrical words used in the song that includes Ujala, Rasna and few more terms that were prominent during those times gets us connected easily.\\nOn the whole, Thaana Serndha Koottam delivers a decent package of music that will definitely be the best in the careers of Suriya, Vignesh Shivn and Anirudh respectively. The songs have the best feel of high energy, emotions, fun, joy and everything that it needs to impress listeners.\\nVerdict : Suriya-Anirudh-Vignesh Shivn trio sparkle in this Chartbuster with great music.\\n#ThaanaSerndhaKoottam #VigneshShivn #Suriya #KeerthySuresh #studioGreen #Anirudh #ThaanaSerndhaKoottamMusicReview\\nHowever been one of the top heroines in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, Keerthy Suresh has been well...\\nDirected by ‘Uriyadi’ fame Director Vijay Kumar and bankrolled by himself under the banner of...\\nProduced under the grand banner of ‘Lyca Productions’, the shooting of K V Anand’s directorial...<break>Clean tidy house with wonderful ocean views.

Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people’s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\\nBeyond Playful Interaction\\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\\n- How can we design installations that endure people’s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\\n- How do different interaction methods shape people’s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people’s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\\nSubmission Details\\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings. We plan to explore approaches and insights from different disciplines to this topic so submissions from art, architecture, design, HCI, media theory, and social science are highly encouraged. We welcome all methodological approaches and techniques centered around the topic of large interactive displays in urban life.\\nAt least one author of each accepted position paper needs to register for the workshop and for one or more days of the CHI conference itself.\\nImportant Dates\\nSubmission Deadline: January 14, 2011\\nNotification of acceptance: February 11, 2011\\nWorkshop: May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS\\nUta Hinrichs is a PhD candidate in computational media design at the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group of the University of Calgary, Canada, under the supervision of Sheelagh Carpendale.

Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned “a recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. ” The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar’s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a “butch-femme” powerful, where in actuality the “butch, ” or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the “man’s” role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex – purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. – and also the “femme, ” or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the “woman’s” role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the “butches” usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the “femmes” sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with “opposite intercourse” had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the “three article” rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly. Raids on homosexual pubs had been regular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but were especially violent, frequently intimately violent, at lesbian pubs. Ladies arrested in club raids had been provided for the Women’s House that is nearby of (demolished), which Joan Nestle, author and co-founder regarding the Lesbian Herstory Archives, said ended up being sardonically described one of the club clients due to the fact “Country Club. ”\\nBecause of the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been a full-time lesbian bar with three primary areas. The space that is first where in fact the primary entry at 52 Eighth Avenue had been situated (presently Art club), had the bar’s just operating egress with uncovered windows, which makes it probably the most general general general public. In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club. Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia “because they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we’d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. ” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\\n“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”\\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The “back space” (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks. ”\\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs. One former regular said of her experience during the water Colony (her punctuation), “my first bar within the town was at the sixties in the SEA COLONY…………. Its as you come in a film as your head starts a lens into the last……. Everyone sluggish danced on to the floor. Lights were dim…. And Maria had been the bar maid/butch…who everybody wanted….

Gisele Amantea's twenty-five year career features in a stunning new hardcover volume. Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea's installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea's career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist's current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.\\n- Author BiographyEve-Lyne Beaudry is curator of contemporary art at the Musee d'Art de Joliette.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers\\' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service<break>Overview\\nBy at the very least 1955 through the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been the most popular lesbian pubs in Greenwich Village.\\nA popular of author and activist Joan Nestle, amongst others, it absolutely was a sanctuary specifically for working-class lesbians in the right time, regardless of being Mafia-run and frequently raided because of the authorities.\\nView the Comprehensive Map\\nThe ocean Colony, very very very first floor of 52, 50, and 48 Eighth Avenue (left to right), 1964.

Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it\\'s Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\\nSA = Sexual Assault\\nST = Sex Trafficking\\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\\n*Children’s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\\n*DV Community Education – 1989,\\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney’s Office 1992 to 2002,\\n*Crisis Intervention Team.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers\\' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service<break>Port Harcourt – The Rivers police command on Wednesday arraigned 13 suspects before a Port Harcourt Magistrates’ Court charged with conspiracy and murder of four students of the University of Port Harcourt.\\nThe suspects were arraigned on a five-count charge of murder, felony, conspiracy, lynching, and burning.\\nProsecuting police Adiari Idafi told the court, presided over by Magistrate Emma Woke, that the accused on Oct. 5, allegedly murdered Chiadika Lordson, Ugonna Kelechi Obusor, Mike Lloyd Toku and Tekena Elkanah.\\nIdafi named the accused as Hassan Welewa, 59 (Male), Lawal Segun, 28 (Male), Lucky Orji, 43 (Male), Cynthia Chinwo, 24 (Female), Ekpe Daniel, 30 (Male).\\nOthers are George Nwadei, 20 (Male), Gabriel Oche, 33 (Male) Ozioma Abajuo, 23 (Male), Chigozie Evans Samuel, 22 (Male), Endurance Edet, 27 (Male), and Endurance Okoghiroh, 24 (Male).\\nAlso arraigned were David Chinasa Ugbaje, 30 (Male) and Ikechukwu Louis Amadi, alias Kapoon, 32 (Male).\\nIdafi stated that the offence was punishable under Section 324 of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Laws of River State, Nigeria, 1999, and Section 319 of the Criminal Code Cap 37 Vol. III laws of Rivers State, Nigeria, 1999.\\nThe accused were asked by the court if they understood the charges and they consented, but no pleas were taken.\\nThe magistrate ordered that the accused be remained in police custody for further investigation, and adjourned the case till Dec. 20, for further hearing.

Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned “a recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. ” The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar’s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a “butch-femme” powerful, where in actuality the “butch, ” or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the “man’s” role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex – purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. – and also the “femme, ” or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the “woman’s” role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the “butches” usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the “femmes” sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with “opposite intercourse” had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the “three article” rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly.

Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth\\'s system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA\\'s Earth Science Division.\\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\\nIn Earth\\'s orbit, the satellites\\' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\\nRuf, the project\\'s principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we\\'ll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\\n\"There\\'s several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\\nRuf added that the satellites\\' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it\\'s been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn\\'t been done before, according to Ruf.\\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that\\'s a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there\\'s been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it\\'s a measurement that we don\\'t have globally but it\\'s using technology that we don\\'t have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We\\'ve had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.'}, {'question': 'What is the street address for Beliveau Estate?', 'answer': 'The address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060.', 'response': 'The street address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060.', 'reference_context': 'Beliveau Estate\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\\n- 855-516-1090\\nAbout The Hotel\\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\\nFEATURED\\nAMENITIES\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\\nHotel Location\\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\\nTraveler Sentiments\\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\\nHelpful Info & FAQs\\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities', 'retrieved_context': '<break>Press Release\\nArgos Announces Issuance of Patent Covering the Foundation for Manufacturing its HIV Immunotherapy\\nDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Argos Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients\\' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics.

Gisele Amantea\\'s twenty-five year career features in a stunning new hardcover volume. Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea\\'s installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea\\'s career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist\\'s current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.\\n- Author BiographyEve-Lyne Beaudry is curator of contemporary art at the Musee d\\'Art de Joliette.

I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock’s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don’t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you’re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us. Let the Master of Suspense show you how the old-school use to do it, before the Hollywood thriller became formulaic.

However I’ve just come across Roxanne Millar’s book ‘The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus’.\\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\\n- SAFe [SAFe].\\nSAFe describes NFRs as “persistent qualities and constraints”.\\nMany NFRs begin their lives as ‘Enablers’ that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 – Responding to Cohn’s post] proposes an alternative format:\\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of ‘Supplementary Requirements’ listing all NFRs.\\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the ‘SAFe Requirements model’ presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb’s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don’t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example – see [SAFe].\\nGilb says:\\n“…it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts”. “Quality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable”.\\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued – See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb’s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler’s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\\nConclusion\\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\\nReferences:\\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing – Gabrielle Benefield\\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\\n- [Gilb] What’s Wrong With Agile Methods –Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification – Gilb & Brodie 2007\\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract\"}, {'question': 'What was the outcome that Nelson had anticipated for the battle he had sought for two years?', 'answer': 'The context does not provide specific information about the outcome that Nelson had anticipated for the battle he had sought for two years.', 'response': \"I don't know.\", 'reference_context': \"Nelson had sought the battle for two years, and he knew full well what the outcome would be.Read More »\\nNelson and Trafalgar\\nNelson had sought the battle for two years, and he knew full well what the outcome would be.\\n$23,Reading,Blue, Household , Vision,Light,Glasses.,Anti,DIDINSKY,Anti,Ferrar,and,Glare.,/consist84330.html Under blast sales DIDINSKY Reading Glasses.

Thanks to the Museum regarding the City of brand new York.\\nHistory\\nInitially exposed as being a restaurant c. 1950, the ocean Colony had become a hangout that is lesbian at minimum 1955, whenever Ann Bannon, composer of lesbian pulp fiction, visited it with Marijane Meaker, writer of lesbian-themed fiction. Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned “a recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. ” The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar’s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a “butch-femme” powerful, where in actuality the “butch, ” or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the “man’s” role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex – purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. – and also the “femme, ” or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the “woman’s” role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the “butches” usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the “femmes” sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with “opposite intercourse” had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the “three article” rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly. Raids on homosexual pubs had been regular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but were especially violent, frequently intimately violent, at lesbian pubs. Ladies arrested in club raids had been provided for the Women’s House that is nearby of (demolished), which Joan Nestle, author and co-founder regarding the Lesbian Herstory Archives, said ended up being sardonically described one of the club clients due to the fact “Country Club. ”\\nBecause of the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been a full-time lesbian bar with three primary areas. The space that is first where in fact the primary entry at 52 Eighth Avenue had been situated (presently Art club), had the bar’s just operating egress with uncovered windows, which makes it probably the most general general general public. In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club. Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia “because they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we’d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. ” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\\n“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”\\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The “back space” (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks. ”\\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs. One former regular said of her experience during the water Colony (her punctuation), “my first bar within the town was at the sixties in the SEA COLONY…………. Its as you come in a film as your head starts a lens into the last……. Everyone sluggish danced on to the floor. Lights were dim…. And Maria had been the bar maid/butch…who everybody wanted….

From his earliest years Currie forged a pioneering path in commissioning and creating new music for percussion. In recognition of this commitment, he received the Royal Philharmonic Society Young Artist Award in 2000, a Borletti-Buitoni Trust Award in 2005 and the Royal Philharmonic Society Instrumentalist Award in 2015. Currie has premiered works. Currie’s 2017-18 season includes premieres of works by Andy Akiho, Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Brett Dean, Joe Duddell and Dave Maric. In the coming seasons Currie will premiere works by Helen Grime and Simon Holt.\\nCurrie currently serves as Artist in Association at London’s Southbank Centre, where he was the focus of a major percussion festival in 2014, and this season Currie completes his three year term as Artist in Residence with the Oregon Symphony Orchestra. The 2017-18 season also features a series of solo recitals at the Schubert Club, Budapest’s Liszt Academy, Lawrence University and Sir James MacMillan’s The Cumnock Tryst Music Festival. Orchestral engagements include performances here and with the Antwerp Symphony, BBC Philharmonic, Het Gelders Orkest, National Youth Orchestra of Scotland and the Scottish Chamber and Brno Contemporary Orchestras.\\nCurrie’s ensemble the Colin Currie Group was formed in 2006 to celebrate the music of Steve Reich and made its five-star debut at the BBC Proms. With Reich’s personal endorsement, Currie and his ensemble have become ambassadors for Reich’s Drumming, a work they have performed many times internationally. The group’s debut recording of Drumming is scheduled for release this season. Currie has recorded many concertos, solos and chamber works, including most recently works by Elliott Carter (Ondine) and Simon Holt (NMC). His recording of Rautavaara’s Incantations with the Helsinki Philharmonic and John Storgårds (Ondine) won a 2012 Gramophone Award, and his recording of Jennifer Higdon’s Percussion Concerto with the London Philharmonic and Marin Alsop won a 2010 Grammy Award.\\nColin Currie plays Zildjan cymbals and is a MarimbaOne Artist.

Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people’s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\\nBeyond Playful Interaction\\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\\n- How can we design installations that endure people’s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\\n- How do different interaction methods shape people’s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people’s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\\nSubmission Details\\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings. We plan to explore approaches and insights from different disciplines to this topic so submissions from art, architecture, design, HCI, media theory, and social science are highly encouraged. We welcome all methodological approaches and techniques centered around the topic of large interactive displays in urban life.\\nAt least one author of each accepted position paper needs to register for the workshop and for one or more days of the CHI conference itself.\\nImportant Dates\\nSubmission Deadline: January 14, 2011\\nNotification of acceptance: February 11, 2011\\nWorkshop: May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS\\nUta Hinrichs is a PhD candidate in computational media design at the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group of the University of Calgary, Canada, under the supervision of Sheelagh Carpendale.

Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers\\' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service<break>CURRENTLY SOLD OUT\\nGisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths by Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, Rebecca Duclos (Hard book explores twenty-five years of work from contemporary artist Gisele Amantea.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients\\' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company\\'s technology and prevent others from infringing it;<break>Beliveau Estate\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\\n- 855-516-1090\\nAbout The Hotel\\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\\nFEATURED\\nAMENITIES\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\\nHotel Location\\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\\nTraveler Sentiments\\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\\nHelpful Info & FAQs\\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities'}, {'question': 'What is required for a patient to use medical marijuana in the state of New York?', 'answer': 'Patients who are certified by a licensed healthcare practitioner to use medical marijuana in New York are required to register with the New York State Department of Health and must obtain a New York medical marijuana card.

We work with many people regardless of race, religion, gender, sexuality or disability.\\nAsha's Niche\\nHISTORY- The Asha Project is the rebirth of Asha Family Services, Inc. (Asha). Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it's Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\\nSA = Sexual Assault\\nST = Sex Trafficking\\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\\n*Children’s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\\n*DV Community Education – 1989,\\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney’s Office 1992 to 2002,\\n*Crisis Intervention Team. Asha Advocates and District 5 City of Milwaukee Police Officers team up to respond to DV crime scenes to provide enhanced and immediate victim services 1995-97\\n*Ujima Men’s Program 1994, a non-traditional abuser treatment program culturally specific to African American men who abuse and batter women.\\n*State licensed Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Clinic-1995-2012\\n*Healthy Beginnings Project (Black Health Coalition of WI) Asha DV/SA, substance abuse and mental health counselor see pregnant women in Milwaukee County Jail-1995-2005.\\n*HIV and STD testing, treatment and prevention – 1999-2011 State of WI\\n*Transitional Housing for women released from Prison-2006 to 2010,\\n*Transitional Housing (long-term) for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Dating Violence and their children who are homeless due to victimization-2007-2010,\\n*Employment training and skill building. Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service<break>I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security. As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.\\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:\\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\\nThe last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:\\n- How to make a backup?\\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.\\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\\nThe books is available online here.\\nProfile<break>: nicotine lozengeFind trials that include: Any drugs shownTrial Status: Closed Results 1-5 of 5 for your search: Start Over Select All on Page Sort by: Phase of Trial Title Type of Trial Status of Trial Age Range Sponsor of Trial Protocol IDs Show 10 25 50 100 200 Results per Page 1.

Medical content reviewed by Dr. Richard Koffler, MD, Board Certified Physiatrist\\nThe State of New York passed a piece of marijuana legislation that effectively establishes a state-regulated medical marijuana program. While the measure itself narrows down the amount of qualifying diagnoses or conditions that would qualify a patient for the therapeutic use of cannabis within the state, New York’s program was drafted with careful and strict controls that will operate under very tight regulation and oversight.\\nPatients who are certified by a licensed healthcare practitioner to use medical marijuana in New York are required to register with the New York State Department of Health and must obtain a New York medical marijuana card, which will serve as a means of identification for the state-sanctioned patient registry.\\nThe passage of this bill makes New York the 23rd state in the country, to set the foundation for a medical marijuana program. “The Compassionate Care Act” outlines a limited list of different debilitating medical conditions, for which marijuana is recommended to be medically beneficial. Before the bill’s passage, state lawmakers narrowed down the list of qualifying conditions that would allow a patient to qualify for the program. Legislators removed glaucoma – citing better pharmaceutical options – and narrowed “arthritis” specifically down to just “rheumatoid arthritis”.\\n* Please note: In order to become registered as a New York medical marijuana patient, you MUST first possess a document-driven condition that has been clearly outlined by the New York State Department of Health’s list of qualifying conditions (as per the Compassionate Care Act). The New York Health Commissioner must decide whether to add Alzheimer’s, muscular dystrophy, dystonia, PTSD, and rheumatoid arthritis within 18 months of the law’s effective date.

The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.\\nI was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.\\nI was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn\\'t realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.\\nIf you\\'re working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you\\'ll love it.

It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can\\'t wait until it\\'s back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)\\n- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam\\n- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it\\'s silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it\\'s not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they\\'re so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.\\nSecond, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I\\'m not a huge scent person so don\\'t like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you\\'re rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.\\nSo really, it\\'s perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store!

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients\\' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients\\' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company\\'s technology and prevent others from infringing it;<break>Beliveau Estate\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\\n- 855-516-1090\\nAbout The Hotel\\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\\nFEATURED\\nAMENITIES\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\\nHotel Location\\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\\nTraveler Sentiments\\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\\nHelpful Info & FAQs\\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities'}, {'question': 'What are the two main sections of the book about mobile security published by Packt?', 'answer': 'The two main sections of the book are a review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices, and tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices.', 'response': 'The book about mobile security published by Packt is divided into two main sections:\\n1.

However I’ve just come across Roxanne Millar’s book ‘The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus’.\\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\\n- SAFe [SAFe].\\nSAFe describes NFRs as “persistent qualities and constraints”.\\nMany NFRs begin their lives as ‘Enablers’ that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 – Responding to Cohn’s post] proposes an alternative format:\\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of ‘Supplementary Requirements’ listing all NFRs.\\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the ‘SAFe Requirements model’ presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb’s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don’t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example – see [SAFe].\\nGilb says:\\n“…it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts”. “Quality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable”.\\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued – See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb’s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler’s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\\nConclusion\\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\\nReferences:\\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing – Gabrielle Benefield\\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\\n- [Gilb] What’s Wrong With Agile Methods –Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification – Gilb & Brodie 2007\\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract<break>CURRENTLY SOLD OUT\\nGisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths by Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, Rebecca Duclos (Hard book explores twenty-five years of work from contemporary artist Gisele Amantea.

Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea's installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea's career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent.

Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it's Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\\nSA = Sexual Assault\\nST = Sex Trafficking\\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\\n*Children’s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\\n*DV Community Education – 1989,\\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney’s Office 1992 to 2002,\\n*Crisis Intervention Team.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service\"}, {'question': 'What was the Sea Colony and who was its primary clientele during the 1950s and 1960s?', 'answer': 'The Sea Colony was a popular lesbian bar in Greenwich Village from at least 1955 through the 1960s.

Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia “because they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we’d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. ” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\\n“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”\\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The “back space” (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks. ”\\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs.

Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia “because they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we’d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. ” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\\n“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”\\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The “back space” (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks. ”\\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs. One former regular said of her experience during the water Colony (her punctuation), “my first bar within the town was at the sixties in the SEA COLONY…………. Its as you come in a film as your head starts a lens into the last……. Everyone sluggish danced on to the floor. Lights were dim…. And Maria had been the bar maid/butch…who everybody wanted…. She had been ALL OF THAT. …. ”\\nThis entry had been compiled by task consultant Gwendolyn Stegall.<break>Wildwood New Jersey\\nOn The Town\\nJuly 2012\\nA neo-doo wop sign welcomes visitors to Wildwood.\\nThis sign is atop the TD Bank on Rio Grande Avenue,\\nthe main road onto the Wildwoods barrier Island.\\nDoo Wop in the Wildwoods\\nThe Wildwoods came of age as a vacation destination in the mid-last-century. As a result many of the motels in the Wildwoods were built with themes that were popular in that era and would have attracted young families. It was the age of the automobile, the sputnik and the space race, of Hawaiian / Polynesian fascination, and many other post World War themes. The motels of that era reflected those aspirational times and themes in their architecture and decorative theming.\\nThe Wildwoods of today have embraced those themed architectural styles and have labeled them collectively \\'doo wop\\' architecture. Throughout the town are many examples of that style. Many buildings being designed and built today in the Wildwoods also reflect doo wop style.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos\\' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients\\' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company\\'s technology and prevent others from infringing it;<break>Beliveau Estate\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\\n- 855-516-1090\\nAbout The Hotel\\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\\nFEATURED\\nAMENITIES\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\\nHotel Location\\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\\nTraveler Sentiments\\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\\nHelpful Info & FAQs\\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities<break>Key Services include: *Domestic violence victim/survivor case management * Crisis Intervention * Advocacy * Safety Planning * Abuser/Batterer Counseling * Parenting * Anger Management and Job training at Sistahs\\'.\\nWho we serve...Victims and survivors of domestic/sexual violence * Sex trafficking victims * In custody/post incarceration * Abusers/Batterers * Families of victims/survivors.

Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it\\'s Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\\nSA = Sexual Assault\\nST = Sex Trafficking\\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\\n*Children’s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\\n*DV Community Education – 1989,\\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney’s Office 1992 to 2002,\\n*Crisis Intervention Team.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers\\' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service'}, {'question': 'What was the reviewer\\'s opinion about the game \"Space Maze 3D\"?', 'answer': 'The reviewer rated \"Space Maze 3D\" 3 out of 5 stars.

As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.\\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:\\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\\nThe last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:\\n- How to make a backup?\\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.\\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\\nThe books is available online here.\\nProfile<break>- Returns\\n- Our History\\n- Our NYC Store\\n- H.G.T.

She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.\\nI was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.\\nIf you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it.

It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)\\n- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam\\n- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.\\nSecond, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.\\nSo really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store!

Be it their association for complete album like Naanum Rowdy Dhaan or other tracks where Vignesh Benz the lyrics, it's been a great delight to the listeners for the packaging of fascination they deliver. Now the duo is back with their latest outing ' Thaana Serndha Kootam' featuring Suriya and Keerthy Suresh in lead roles. K.E. Gnanavel Raja studio Green films bankrolled this movie, which happens to be a remake of superhit Hindi movie Special 26. The album has 5 songs based on different genres.\\nNaana Thana\\nSingers: Anirudh\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nIt's a complete song that takes you through the exciting phase of of moments in love. The lyrics has purity with a peak of playfulness boy's perspective. In fact the song has already been a favourite of town people from the time it was launched as a single track. There is a lot of energy in the song right on the first second and the musical components or so much invigorating to the senses. Anirudh has picked the style of that Hindi stage performance where the fill-ins with harmonium and vocalism are evident.\\nSodakku\\nSingers: Antony Dasan\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThe song needs no introduction as it has already through to be a strong winner in the charts. The song has highly enthusiastic appeal from musical team. On a precise note, this happens to be the first ever fast paced folk song for Suriya in the recent times. The high level energy pumping percussion and unparalleled rendition by Antony Dasan makes the song more enjoyable. Not to miss the interludes that comes with fast running notes on Veena, which is exotically unparalleled.\\nThaana Serndha Koottam\\nSingers: Anirudh and Vignesh Shivn\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThe song has lots of values on the lyrical part and it looks like this would be placed during a crucial moment of the movie. The distorted guitar on the backdrops along with the rhythmic accompaniment add more sense to the peppiness. The kind of rendition by both Anirudh and Vignesh belong to a unique panache. This could get more prominence with the visual presentation of the song.\\nEngae Endru Povadhu\\nSingers: Anirudh and Shakthishree Gopalan\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nThere are certain times, where a particular song manages to get beyond the premise of a movie and touch us unconditionally. It is decided by the theme of the song, the lyrical Phrases and of course the musical presentation that would imbibe to our senses. This song brings out such traits in a great way that the song instantly appeals to our attention. The lyrical lines are so much simple and yet compelling that was down a lot of emotions. Anirudh has always been a master of such musical style and it just enables the song to get propelled to a greater stroke.\\nPeela Peela\\nSingers: Jassie Gift, Nakash Aziz and Mali\\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\\nInnovative lyrics and fun filled music makes the song click well at the very initial level you start listening to it. As known to many, TSK is set in the time period of 80s and henceforth, the lyrical words used in the song that includes Ujala, Rasna and few more terms that were prominent during those times gets us connected easily.\\nOn the whole, Thaana Serndha Koottam delivers a decent package of music that will definitely be the best in the careers of Suriya, Vignesh Shivn and Anirudh respectively. The songs have the best feel of high energy, emotions, fun, joy and everything that it needs to impress listeners.\\nVerdict : Suriya-Anirudh-Vignesh Shivn trio sparkle in this Chartbuster with great music.\\n#ThaanaSerndhaKoottam #VigneshShivn #Suriya #KeerthySuresh #studioGreen #Anirudh #ThaanaSerndhaKoottamMusicReview\\nHowever been one of the top heroines in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, Keerthy Suresh has been well...\\nDirected by ‘Uriyadi’ fame Director Vijay Kumar and bankrolled by himself under the banner of...\\nProduced under the grand banner of ‘Lyca Productions’, the shooting of K V Anand’s directorial...\"}, {'question': 'What are the common features of the Quince Hand Lotion as described by the reviewers?', 'answer': \"The Quince Hand Lotion is described as light, fragrance-free, non-greasy, and fast-absorbing.

Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.\\nSecond, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.\\nSo really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store!

I love that I can use it while I am driving and throw my hands right back onto the wheel because it absorbs THAT FAST!\\n(Posted on 11/3/14)\\n- Great product Review by Sally\\n- Fantastic product for dry SENSITIVE skin. Works great! (Posted on 7/2/13)\\n- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax\\n- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida. The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.\\nI was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.\\nI was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.\\nIf you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it.

As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.\\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:\\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\\nThe last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:\\n- How to make a backup?\\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.\\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\\nThe books is available online here.\\nProfile<break>Contact Info / Websites\\nRecent Game Reviews\\nSpace Maze 3D\\nRated 3 / 5 stars\\nIt reminds me of the maze screensaver that used to come with Windows lol.

Gisele Amantea's twenty-five year career features in a stunning new hardcover volume. Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea's installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea's career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist's current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.\\n- Author BiographyEve-Lyne Beaudry is curator of contemporary art at the Musee d'Art de Joliette.

Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people’s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\\nBeyond Playful Interaction\\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\\n- How can we design installations that endure people’s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\\n- How do different interaction methods shape people’s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people’s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\\nSubmission Details\\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings. We plan to explore approaches and insights from different disciplines to this topic so submissions from art, architecture, design, HCI, media theory, and social science are highly encouraged. We welcome all methodological approaches and techniques centered around the topic of large interactive displays in urban life.\\nAt least one author of each accepted position paper needs to register for the workshop and for one or more days of the CHI conference itself.\\nImportant Dates\\nSubmission Deadline: January 14, 2011\\nNotification of acceptance: February 11, 2011\\nWorkshop: May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS\\nUta Hinrichs is a PhD candidate in computational media design at the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group of the University of Calgary, Canada, under the supervision of Sheelagh Carpendale.

Sistahs’ Café & Deli– 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha\\'s Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers\\' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\\n*Programs & Services\\n*Who We Service'}, {'question': 'Who are the authors of the book \"Gisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths\"?', 'answer': 'The authors of the book \"Gisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths\" are Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, and Rebecca Duclos.', 'response': 'The authors of the book \"Gisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths\" are Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, and Rebecca Duclos.', 'reference_context': \"CURRENTLY SOLD OUT\\nGisele Amantea: Sweet Dreams, Hard Truths by Denise Markonish, Eve-Lyne Beaudry, Rebecca Duclos (Hard book explores twenty-five years of work from contemporary artist Gisele Amantea.

As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any “connected” device to be honest). Chapter 1 (“Living in a mobile world“) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our “because of“) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (“Users and Mobile Device Management”) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a “MUM” (“Mobile User Management“) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: “Small Word, Big consequences“. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it’s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes – it’s considered as a threat) and viruses.\\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called “Protecting your mobile devices“. Basically, it’s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I’ve to mention some good tips covered like:\\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don’t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you’re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (“BYOD“). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\\nThe last chapter covers the case when you’ve been hacked. How to get your life back? “Your life” is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, …). This chapter gives tips like:\\n- How to make a backup?\\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of “Mobile Acceptable User Policy“.\\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you’ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\\nThe books is available online here.\\nProfile<break>Overview\\nBy at the very least 1955 through the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been the most popular lesbian pubs in Greenwich Village.\\nA popular of author and activist Joan Nestle, amongst others, it absolutely was a sanctuary specifically for working-class lesbians in the right time, regardless of being Mafia-run and frequently raided because of the authorities.\\nView the Comprehensive Map\\nThe ocean Colony, very very very first floor of 52, 50, and 48 Eighth Avenue (left to right), 1964. Picture by John Barrngton Bayley. Thanks to the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission.\\nApproximate Water Colony flooring plan. Drawn by Gwendolyn Stegall for the NYC LGBT Historic web web Sites Project in discussion with water Colony bartender Preston Mardenborough.\\nWomen’s home of Detention (demolished), Greenwich Avenue between western tenth Street and Christopher Street, 1945. Thanks to the Museum regarding the City of brand new York.\\nHistory\\nInitially exposed as being a restaurant c. 1950, the ocean Colony had become a hangout that is lesbian at minimum 1955, whenever Ann Bannon, composer of lesbian pulp fiction, visited it with Marijane Meaker, writer of lesbian-themed fiction. Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned “a recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. ” The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar’s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a “butch-femme” powerful, where in actuality the “butch, ” or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the “man’s” role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex – purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. – and also the “femme, ” or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the “woman’s” role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the “butches” usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the “femmes” sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with “opposite intercourse” had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the “three article” rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly. Raids on homosexual pubs had been regular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but were especially violent, frequently intimately violent, at lesbian pubs. Ladies arrested in club raids had been provided for the Women’s House that is nearby of (demolished), which Joan Nestle, author and co-founder regarding the Lesbian Herstory Archives, said ended up being sardonically described one of the club clients due to the fact “Country Club. ”\\nBecause of the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been a full-time lesbian bar with three primary areas. The space that is first where in fact the primary entry at 52 Eighth Avenue had been situated (presently Art club), had the bar’s just operating egress with uncovered windows, which makes it probably the most general general general public. In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club. Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia “because they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we’d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. ” In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\\n“Every evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. … This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. ”\\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The “back space” (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the “back space. ” Then, he stated, “Everything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they’re having drinks. ”\\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs. One former regular said of her experience during the water Colony (her punctuation), “my first bar within the town was at the sixties in the SEA COLONY…………. Its as you come in a film as your head starts a lens into the last……. Everyone sluggish danced on to the floor. Lights were dim…. And Maria had been the bar maid/butch…who everybody wanted…. She had been ALL OF THAT. …. ”\\nThis entry had been compiled by task consultant Gwendolyn Stegall.<break>Contact Info / Websites\\nRecent Game Reviews\\nSpace Maze 3D\\nRated 3 / 5 stars\\nIt reminds me of the maze screensaver that used to come with Windows lol. I did not find the end, so I cannot comment on whatever reward there may or may not be at the end of the maze. To tell you the truth, first person view drives me nuts, but that isn't reflected in my rating. Maybe if there were some variances in the design of the walls, it might have kept my attention. Some eerie music in the background would have been nice; Distressing count-down-type music would have added to the urgency and the desire to find the exit.\\nKept me playing for almost 10 stages. Would have played longer, but I'm too lazy to sit and solve level 10.
