Be it their association for complete album like Naanum Rowdy Dhaan or other tracks where Vignesh Benz the lyrics, it's been a great delight to the listeners for the packaging of fascination they deliver. Now the duo is back with their latest outing ' Thaana Serndha Kootam' featuring Suriya and Keerthy Suresh in lead roles. K.E.

The album has 5 songs based on different genres.\nNaana Thana\nSingers: Anirudh\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nIt's a complete song that takes you through the exciting phase of of moments in love. The lyrics has purity with a peak of playfulness boy's perspective. In fact the song has already been a favourite of town people from the time it was launched as a single track. There is a lot of energy in the song right on the first second and the musical components or so much invigorating to the senses. Anirudh has picked the style of that Hindi stage performance where the fill-ins with harmonium and vocalism are evident.\nSodakku\nSingers: Antony Dasan\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nThe song needs no introduction as it has already through to be a strong winner in the charts. The song has highly enthusiastic appeal from musical team. On a precise note, this happens to be the first ever fast paced folk song for Suriya in the recent times. The high level energy pumping percussion and unparalleled rendition by Antony Dasan makes the song more enjoyable. Not to miss the interludes that comes with fast running notes on Veena, which is exotically unparalleled.\nThaana Serndha Koottam\nSingers: Anirudh and Vignesh Shivn\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nThe song has lots of values on the lyrical part and it looks like this would be placed during a crucial moment of the movie. The distorted guitar on the backdrops along with the rhythmic accompaniment add more sense to the peppiness. The kind of rendition by both Anirudh and Vignesh belong to a unique panache.

It is decided by the theme of the song, the lyrical Phrases and of course the musical presentation that would imbibe to our senses. This song brings out such traits in a great way that the song instantly appeals to our attention. The lyrical lines are so much simple and yet compelling that was down a lot of emotions. Anirudh has always been a master of such musical style and it just enables the song to get propelled to a greater stroke.\nPeela Peela\nSingers: Jassie Gift, Nakash Aziz and Mali\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nInnovative lyrics and fun filled music makes the song click well at the very initial level you start listening to it.

        "reference": "Key Services include: *Domestic violence victim/survivor case management * Crisis Intervention * Advocacy * Safety Planning * Abuser/Batterer Counseling * Parenting * Anger Management and Job training at Sistahs'.\nWho we serve...Victims and survivors of domestic/sexual violence * Sex trafficking victims * In custody/post incarceration * Abusers/Batterers * Families of victims/survivors. We work with many people regardless of race, religion, gender, sexuality or disability.\nAsha's Niche\nHISTORY- The Asha Project is the rebirth of Asha Family Services, Inc. (Asha). Asha is a domestic and sex trafficking prevention organization specializing in African American culturally specific services, located in the central city of Milwaukee, WI. Asha was founded in 1989 and developed by it's Chief Executive Officer, Antonia A. Drew Vann.\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\nSA = Sexual Assault\nST = Sex Trafficking\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\n*Children\u2019s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\n*DV Community Education \u2013 1989,\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney\u2019s Office 1992 to 2002,\n*Crisis Intervention Team. Asha Advocates and District 5 City of Milwaukee Police Officers team up to respond to DV crime scenes to provide enhanced and immediate victim services 1995-97\n*Ujima Men\u2019s Program 1994, a non-traditional abuser treatment program culturally specific to African American men who abuse and batter women.\n*State licensed Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Clinic-1995-2012\n*Healthy Beginnings Project (Black Health Coalition of WI) Asha DV/SA, substance abuse and mental health counselor see pregnant women in Milwaukee County Jail-1995-2005.\n*HIV and STD testing, treatment and prevention \u2013 1999-2011 State of WI\n*Transitional Housing for women released from Prison-2006 to 2010,\n*Transitional Housing (long-term) for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Dating Violence and their children who are homeless due to victimization-2007-2010,\n*Employment training and skill building. Sistahs\u2019 Caf\u00e9 & Deli\u2013 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\n*Programs & Services\n*Who We Service",

Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\n*Programs & Services\n*Who We Service<break>Key Services include: *Domestic violence victim/survivor case management * Crisis Intervention * Advocacy * Safety Planning * Abuser/Batterer Counseling * Parenting * Anger Management and Job training at Sistahs'.\nWho we serve...Victims and survivors of domestic/sexual violence * Sex trafficking victims * In custody/post incarceration * Abusers/Batterers * Families of victims/survivors.

Drew Vann.\nThe new Asha Project is in partnership with End Domestic Abuse WI/Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\nHISTORY OF SERVICES: Asha began providing its initial services as follows:\nDV = Domestic Violence/Abuse\nSA = Sexual Assault\nST = Sex Trafficking\n*Sex Trafficking Victim Services 1988\n*Domestic and Sexual Violence (DV/SA) Victim safety services-1989.\n*Children who witness violence services-1990.\n*Children\u2019s DV safety groups in Schools-1993 to 2007\n*DV/SA Victim Case management- 1989\n*DV Community Education \u2013 1989,\n*In Prison Support Groups for female victim services,\n*In Prison Education Groups for men, 1990,\n*Opened victim offices in District Attorney\u2019s Office 1992 to 2002,\n*Crisis Intervention Team. Asha Advocates and District 5 City of Milwaukee Police Officers team up to respond to DV crime scenes to provide enhanced and immediate victim services 1995-97\n*Ujima Men\u2019s Program 1994, a non-traditional abuser treatment program culturally specific to African American men who abuse and batter women.\n*State licensed Outpatient Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Clinic-1995-2012\n*Healthy Beginnings Project (Black Health Coalition of WI) Asha DV/SA, substance abuse and mental health counselor see pregnant women in Milwaukee County Jail-1995-2005.\n*HIV and STD testing, treatment and prevention \u2013 1999-2011 State of WI\n*Transitional Housing for women released from Prison-2006 to 2010,\n*Transitional Housing (long-term) for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Dating Violence and their children who are homeless due to victimization-2007-2010,\n*Employment training and skill building. Sistahs\u2019 Caf\u00e9 & Deli\u2013 2008-2011 - under redevelopment.\nThe Heart and Pulse of Asha is Culturally Specific African American Programs. Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\n*Programs & Services\n*Who We Service"

As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any \u201cconnected\u201d device to be honest). Chapter 1 (\u201cLiving in a mobile world\u201c) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our \u201cbecause of\u201c) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (\u201cUsers and Mobile Device Management\u201d) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a \u201cMUM\u201d (\u201cMobile User Management\u201c) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: \u201cSmall Word, Big consequences\u201c. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it\u2019s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes \u2013 it\u2019s considered as a threat) and viruses.\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called \u201cProtecting your mobile devices\u201c. Basically, it\u2019s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I\u2019ve to mention some good tips covered like:\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don\u2019t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you\u2019re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (\u201cBYOD\u201c). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\nThe last chapter covers the case when you\u2019ve been hacked. How to get your life back? \u201cYour life\u201d is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, \u2026). This chapter gives tips like:\n- How to make a backup?\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of \u201cMobile Acceptable User Policy\u201c.\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you\u2019ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\nThe books is available online here.\nProfile<break>I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis\u00ae precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company's technology and prevent others from infringing it;<break>Beliveau Estate\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\n- 855-516-1090\nAbout The Hotel\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\nFEATURED\nAMENITIES\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\nHotel Location\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\nTraveler Sentiments\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\nHelpful Info & FAQs\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities<break>Press Release\nArgos Announces Issuance of Patent Covering the Foundation for Manufacturing its HIV Immunotherapy\nDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Argos Therapeutics Inc.

We had a nice big room with an incredible view from the balcony. Pretty much an outstanding view from all areas. Very peacfeul and beautiful area. Close to the beach. If you don't have a car its good to get all your groceries before going. If you do have a car then it is very conveniently located to everything close by.\nI loved staying at this cozy hideaway. You wake up to the sound of howler monkeys and parrots. A great place to soothe the soul and spark the spirit and love for nature. The view is terrific-overlooking the jungle out towards the ocean to see whales with wildlife walking through the backyard. Darren is a welcoming, kind, and personable host willing to share his piece of paradise. He provides great information of things to do and places to see and assisted in making arrangements for car rental, taxi, tours etc. The accommodations were very clean, comfortable, and homey. I hope to go back!\nLove nature, animals and wildlife, music, guitar, surfing, diving. Healthy living, good food and good times. Peaceful and adventurous. Think outside the box.

If you don't have a car its good to get all your groceries before going. If you do have a car then it is very conveniently located to everything close by.\nI loved staying at this cozy hideaway. You wake up to the sound of howler monkeys and parrots. A great place to soothe the soul and spark the spirit and love for nature. The view is terrific-overlooking the jungle out towards the ocean to see whales with wildlife walking through the backyard. Darren is a welcoming, kind, and personable host willing to share his piece of paradise. He provides great information of things to do and places to see and assisted in making arrangements for car rental, taxi, tours etc. The accommodations were very clean, comfortable, and homey. I hope to go back!\nLove nature, animals and wildlife, music, guitar, surfing, diving. Healthy living, good food and good times. Peaceful and adventurous. Think outside the box.

(NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis\u00ae precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics. Initial data from the ongoing clinical trial is expected during the second half the patents and patent applications owned or licensed by the Company, such as the patent referred to in this release, will protect the Company's technology and prevent others from infringing it;<break>Beliveau Estate\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA 24060\n- 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd , Blacksburg, VA - 24060\n- 855-516-1090\nAbout The Hotel\nAbout Beliveau Estate Hotel\nFEATURED\nAMENITIES\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities\nHotel Location\nNearest airport and around Beliveau Estate - Blacksburg, VA Hotel\nGroup Hotel Rates(9+ Rooms)\nGet competing quotes for free and save up to 70% on group rates for Weddings, Meetings, Sports Teams and other Events.\nWe have lowest special group rates and discounts for any type or group size.\nTraveler Sentiments\nVerified Guest Reviews for Blacksburg, VA Hotels\nHelpful Info & FAQs\nWhat brand is Beliveau Estate?\nBeliveau Estate is an independent hotel.\nWhat is the street address for Beliveau Estate?\nThe address for Beliveau Estate is 5415 Gallion Ridge Rd, Blacksburg, VA 24060 .\nBeliveau Estate Hotel Amenities<break>Press Release\nArgos Announces Issuance of Patent Covering the Foundation for Manufacturing its HIV Immunotherapy\nDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Argos Therapeutics Inc.

        "response": "The prevalent architectural style in Wildwood is 'doo wop' architecture. This style is reflected in the town's buildings through themes and designs popular in the mid-20th century, such as the automobile age, the space race, and Hawaiian/Polynesian fascination. Many buildings, including motels and commercial establishments like supermarkets and sandwich shops in Wildwood, showcase this style with features like neon signage, bright lights, and thematic decorations. New constructions in the area also embrace this style, known as neo-doo wop, which continues to influence the architectural character of Wildwood.",
        "reference": "Wildwood New Jersey\nOn The Town\nJuly 2012\nA neo-doo wop sign welcomes visitors to Wildwood.\nThis sign is atop the TD Bank on Rio Grande Avenue,\nthe main road onto the Wildwoods barrier Island.\nDoo Wop in the Wildwoods\nThe Wildwoods came of age as a vacation destination in the mid-last-century. As a result many of the motels in the Wildwoods were built with themes that were popular in that era and would have attracted young families. It was the age of the automobile, the sputnik and the space race, of Hawaiian / Polynesian fascination, and many other post World War themes. The motels of that era reflected those aspirational times and themes in their architecture and decorative theming.\nThe Wildwoods of today have embraced those themed architectural styles and have labeled them collectively 'doo wop' architecture. Throughout the town are many examples of that style. Many buildings being designed and built today in the Wildwoods also reflect doo wop style. This is refered to as neo-doo wop.\nAn impressionistic neon milk shake?\nThe neo-doo wop ACME Supermarket sign.\nThe Wildwood WAWA reflects a doo wop space-age look.\nThe Subway Sandwich shop in Wildwood displays doo wop styling.\nAn example of a new motel with neo-doo wop styling.\nThe old Wingate motel that once stood on this site was completely rebuilt in 2000 as the neo-doo wop Starlux hotel.\nThe doo wop theming is completed with classic plastic palm trees.\nHere is a portrait in contrast.\nIn the foreground, the Saratoga Inn sports a colonial look and theme\nWhile the Bal Harbour's massive towers, behind, display a late 60's futuristic look.\nThe American Safari has a whimsical adventure theme.\nAgain, notice the plastic palm trees and neon signage.\nOne of many Fresh Fruit guys who visit every street in the Wildwoods\nmultiple times per day and offer fresh fruit for you to enjoy beachside or poolside.\nNot all hotels in Wildwoods are doo wop.\nThe Regis is outside of the doo wop district and doesn't really have a theme.\nThe condo building craze of the mid-2000s created much controversy in the Wildwoods.\nMany doo wop motels were lost to the wrecking ball to make way for condos.\nPictured here is a block of condos where once stood four classic doo wop motels:\nDi Lido's Motel, Casa Bahama Motel, Kona Kai Motel, and Hi Lili Motel.\nThe newer condos of the Wildwoods offer brand new accommodations with plenty of amenities. However, we've noticed the pools are tiny and awkwardly located, as if an afterthought.\nFurthermore, these monstrosities are about as interesting architecturally as shoe boxes.\nAt night they are mostly dark and cheerless. They do not share the Wildwood motel lighting schemes which are demonstrated below.\nHere, some new condo construction going on at the former site of the Captain's Table restaurant.\nThe Captain's Table was a Wildwood Crest staple back in the day and had a wonderful seaside nautical theme.\nIn keeping the retro feeling, the town even has an old fashioned trolley that delivers guests to the boardwalk and back every evening.\nThe Waikiki motel sports a Hawaiian theme\ncomplete with a thatched roof entrance\nand lava stone lined accents.\nAs the sun sets, neon begins to dominate the Wildwood night.\nThe Olympic resort displays its giant neon sign.\nAt night, the doo wop motels of the Wildwoods come alive with neon signs\nand ornate lighting schemes.\nThe Oceanic motel has always fascinated me because it has a bar on the first floor.\nMore lights and bright colors illuminate the night from the Aquarius Motor Inn.\nThe Granada's bright sign and lighted exterior.\nThe Alakai's pineapple colored lighting scheme.\nThe Madrid Motel as seen from the beach.\nIn Florida, a lighting scheme like this would cause environmentalists to go into spasms over concerns for poor sea turtle babies becoming confused.\nThe streets of Wildwood Crest are awash with neon as far you the eye can see.\n",

Review by DBK\n- My husband and I both have extremely dry hands in the winter time, and this is the only product we have found that works without making our hands greasy and grimy feeling. It's light, fragrance-free, and makes your hands feel totally soft and moisturized. (Posted on 4/6/15)\n- The best hand lotion on the market!

(Posted on 2/25/15)\n- Cannot live without it! Review by Beth\n- Hands down one of the best hand creams you could use in those cold months. It 's fast absorbing, not greasy and has a light scent. I love that I can use it while I am driving and throw my hands right back onto the wheel because it absorbs THAT FAST!\n(Posted on 11/3/14)\n- Great product Review by Sally\n- Fantastic product for dry SENSITIVE skin. Works great! (Posted on 7/2/13)\n- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax\n- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida. The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.\nI was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.\nI was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.\nIf you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it. (Posted on 3/31/13)\n- Only thing that work Review by Producer Bill\n- I have dry hands, and I spend tons of time working with them however most hand lotions leave a greasy feeling. This doesn't and it heals my hands. Forget wondering if it will work. I am telling you right now it does and is well worth the cost. (Posted on 2/16/13)\n- Fantastic. Review by HB\n- Hands-down, the absolute best hand-cream I've used...relieves chapping almost immediately for me. Please bring it back SOON!!! (Posted on 2/4/13)\n- best ever Review by deean\n- i just love this hand cream its not greasy at all and soaks right in my hands please bring it back (Posted on 1/22/13)\n- GREAT Review by butterfly6801\n- I love this for hands, but even more than that I love it for my elbows. It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)\n- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam\n- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.\nSecond, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.\nSo really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store!

(Posted on 6/1/12)\n-)<break>I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security. As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any \u201cconnected\u201d device to be honest). Chapter 1 (\u201cLiving in a mobile world\u201c) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our \u201cbecause of\u201c) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (\u201cUsers and Mobile Device Management\u201d) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a \u201cMUM\u201d (\u201cMobile User Management\u201c) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: \u201cSmall Word, Big consequences\u201c. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it\u2019s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes \u2013 it\u2019s considered as a threat) and viruses.\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called \u201cProtecting your mobile devices\u201c. Basically, it\u2019s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I\u2019ve to mention some good tips covered like:\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don\u2019t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you\u2019re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (\u201cBYOD\u201c). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\nThe last chapter covers the case when you\u2019ve been hacked. How to get your life back? \u201cYour life\u201d is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, \u2026). This chapter gives tips like:\n- How to make a backup?\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of \u201cMobile Acceptable User Policy\u201c.\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you\u2019ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\nThe books is available online here.\nProfile<break>I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security.

Where the Wimmenz Are.\nA survey of Catholics in Germany and Switzerland shows that most reject the church's teachings on contraception, divorce, sexual morality and gay unions. This will not change the moral teachings of the church.\nWell, of course not, and not only because the results might be different elsewhere in the world.\nAnd despite some statements by pope Francis, neither is much going to change in the official teachings of the church about the proper place of women*, though it could well be the case that your average Catholic in this country or in Germany or Switzerland might not agree with those teachings, either.\nI have written before about the three pillars on which the general second-class status of women depend** (religion, laws and science/pseudoscience). Out of the three it is religion which is the hardest and the slowest to change, because the holy books, written when cultures were very patriarchal, can always be interpreted as the written law of god.

Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people\u2019s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\nBeyond Playful Interaction\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\n- How can we design installations that endure people\u2019s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\n- How do different interaction methods shape people\u2019s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people\u2019s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\nSubmission Details\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format.

However I\u2019ve just come across Roxanne Millar\u2019s book \u2018The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus\u2019.\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\n- SAFe [SAFe].\nSAFe describes NFRs as \u201cpersistent qualities and constraints\u201d.\nMany NFRs begin their lives as \u2018Enablers\u2019 that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 \u2013 Responding to Cohn\u2019s post] proposes an alternative format:\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of \u2018Supplementary Requirements\u2019 listing all NFRs.\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the \u2018SAFe Requirements model\u2019 presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb\u2019s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below.

However I\u2019ve just come across Roxanne Millar\u2019s book \u2018The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus\u2019.\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\n- SAFe [SAFe].\nSAFe describes NFRs as \u201cpersistent qualities and constraints\u201d.\nMany NFRs begin their lives as \u2018Enablers\u2019 that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 \u2013 Responding to Cohn\u2019s post] proposes an alternative format:\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of \u2018Supplementary Requirements\u2019 listing all NFRs.\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the \u2018SAFe Requirements model\u2019 presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb\u2019s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don\u2019t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example \u2013 see [SAFe].\nGilb says:\n\u201c\u2026it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts\u201d. \u201cQuality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable\u201d.\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation.

        "reference": "CHI 2010 Workshop May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\nCall for Participation\nLarge interactive displays are now common in public urban life. Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people\u2019s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\nBeyond Playful Interaction\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\n- How can we design installations that endure people\u2019s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\n- How do different interaction methods shape people\u2019s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people\u2019s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\nSubmission Details\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings. We plan to explore approaches and insights from different disciplines to this topic so submissions from art, architecture, design, HCI, media theory, and social science are highly encouraged. We welcome all methodological approaches and techniques centered around the topic of large interactive displays in urban life.\nAt least one author of each accepted position paper needs to register for the workshop and for one or more days of the CHI conference itself.\nImportant Dates\nSubmission Deadline: January 14, 2011\nNotification of acceptance: February 11, 2011\nWorkshop: May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\nWORKSHOP ORGANIZERS\nUta Hinrichs is a PhD candidate in computational media design at the Innovations in Visualization (InnoVis) research group of the University of Calgary, Canada, under the supervision of Sheelagh Carpendale.

Asha's Design Rational: Many underlying problems such as poverty, which later manifest themselves in drug and alcohol dependency, domestic and sexual violence, incarceration and child abuse and neglect are often times socio-culturally anchored. As a result, when traditional agencies and methods attempt to meet the needs of some individuals and families from the African American community, the underlying currents, which are actually factors in the cause of the problems, are not adequately addressed, understood or even respected. The issue of domestic violence is complex within the African American community. This complexity is further compounded by problems along racial lines, historical trauma and discrimination, a lack of access to services in the community, and providers' inadequate cultural knowledge of daily issues for victims of abuse residing in the community.\n*Programs & Services\n*Who We Service"

        "response": "Yes, you can get a cash advance without a bank account, but the options are limited. Some payday loans don\u2019t require a bank account and may provide cash directly or load the money onto a prepaid debit card. However, most traditional cash advances through credit cards typically require you to have a bank account.",
        "reference": "Regular charge card pay day loans don\u2019t require a checking account. Sort of. It\u2019s complicated. If you need that loan, your options become a great deal narrower if you don\u0432\u0402\u2122t have a bank account. You can\u0432\u0402\u2122t write a check without one, nor is it possible to head to an ATM. Plus, many loan providers which can be payday nonetheless need you\u2019ve got really a vendor account before they\u0432\u0402\u2122ll lend for you personally. an advance loan might be an alternative solution, but could you will get one with no banking account? The answer allow me expose \u0432\u0402\u00a6 perhaps. To begin with, this can rely in what you recommend by \u0432\u0402\u045acash advance. \u0432\u0402\u045c\nAn advance loan is a mode of charge card deal. Instead of use that is making of card to simply make a purchase, you should utilize a money loan in your card to obtain paper money. The amount that you withdraw is likely to be placed into your total security, the way that is exact exact same the cost of a transaction that is ordinary.\nBesides the money you receive, pay day loans change from normal credit card deals in three important means. First, numerous cards charge a extra expense for taking out an advance loan. Typically this expense is something like \u0432\u0402\u045a$5 or 3percent for the volume withdrawn, whichever is greater. \u0432\u0402\u045c consequently straight away, you ought to invest to get cash insurance firms an advance loan.\n2nd, payday advances tend not to add a pursuit elegance duration that is free.\nWith traditional purchases, there is typically an one month display between when the purchase is established when the purchase volume starts accruing interest. Meaning that when you\u2019re able to spend that stability down in complete prior to the elegance duration finishes, it is possible to avoid spending any additional costs.\nNonetheless with pay day loans, that interest begins accruing right away. Between that interest along with the loan price, there\u0432\u0402\u2122s simply no real option to prevent extra cash this is certainly additional. Plus, the eye costs for pay day loans are really a complete great deal more than the interest charges for regular discounts. If you\u0432\u0402\u2122d like to just you need to a cash loan call at your charge card, it will run you. (fed up with relying on payday advances for crisis costs? Check always away our blog post: Saving ways of Avoid a High Interest payday loan. )\nCan you obtain a credit card without a bank account?\nThe thing that makes we asking this concern? Well, its because it also includes the middle of why giving an answer to this relevant concern could be therefore tricky. See, while charge cards advance loan doesn\u2019t have a bank account, you\u0432\u0402\u2122re probably like to a banking account to have that bank card inside the accepted spot that is first. Theoretically, the clear response is yes. In truth? It\u0432\u0402\u2122s a no.\nYou don\u0432\u0402\u2122t have a bank account, you\u0432\u0402\u2122re going to be away from fortune if you\u0432\u0402\u2122re trying to find a normal unsecured charge card. Almost all charge cards will likely require that you have a bank account before they\u0432\u0402\u2122ll approve you. Devoid of a banking account is a massive red advertising for them it indicates you\u0432\u0402\u2122re greatly predisposed to not ever repay everything you borrow. If you can\u0432\u0402\u2122t just take a charge card away with out a checking account, and that means you won\u0432\u0402\u2122t allow you to geting an advance loan without one either.\nYou\u2019re getting an advance loan with a secured credit card or debit card that is prepaid.\nPeople who don\u0432\u0402\u2122t have bank documents can however make application for a secured credit card. Together with your cards, a money is created for you personally by you deposit into a merchant account that the card issuer opens up. That cash volume then determines your borrowing restriction. So a $500 deposit shall suggest a $500 limitation. You could then use this secured credit card just to just take straight down a loan.\nBut this arrangement raises problem: Why is it possible to make usage of secured charge card to merely you need to take a cash loan out when you could merely utilize the cash that you already deposited to start within the card? Well, the possibilities are excellent which you most likely have credit that is bad you\u0432\u0402\u2122re in this example. Having a credit this is certainly guaranteed and making your instalments on time is a superb choice to raise your credit score up such a long time considering that the card company reports into the credit scoring agencies.\nWhile secured charge cards normally have greater fees ( perhaps not mention more costs) than mainstream bank cards, using some of those is a lot better than exactly what is doing cash. Using one properly can raise your credit rating after a while, ultimately leading that you a card with much better advantages and paid down prices.\nYou could subscribe to a prepaid debit card to just just take straight down a advance loan. The funds are packed straight on your card; the amount of money is yours to spend, without any interest accruing after all with your items. You possibly can make utilization of one of these brilliant cards at an ATM to obtain cash but it\u0432\u0402\u2122ll probably include far more charges as compared to typical standard advance loan would. Plus, unlike guaranteed in full credit cards, a prepaid debit card won\u0432\u0402\u2122t enhance your credit. (to see more about additional options to traditional banking, check our article down: just how to endure in a Banking Desert. )\nSome \u0432\u0402\u045acash advance\u0432\u0402\u045c loans don\u0432\u0402\u2122t need a bank account.\nKeep in mind at the beginning of the time on this page if we talked about payday loan? Those are short-term, high interest no credit check loans that are created to easy and quick however in trade, they are a great deal more high priced than a day to day unsecured loan, and they\u0432\u0402\u2122re aimed at those that have really poor credit ranks. The typical term for a payday loan is something like a few weeks, having a annual part price (APR) of 350per cent.\nHere\u0432\u0402\u2122s the benefit that is plain of time loans: many of them promote by themselves as \u0432\u0402\u045acash advance\u0432\u0402\u045c loans. Despite the fact that numerous payday improvements do require you to have checking account, there are many that don\u0432\u0402\u2122t. Numerous bad credit loans will direct deposit your funds in to the bank bank checking account, but pay day loans that don\u0432\u0402\u2122t require a banking account will either control you cash or will position the money on a debit card that is prepaid.",

This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it\u2014culminating when he performed \"Stan\" at the 2001 Grammys alongside Elton John.

The answer's yes\" are way too literal for a rapper so obsessed with weaving such an intricate web of humor and horror. And there are always lines he won't cross. One verse later he rhymes \"I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker/Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word...\" He stops there. There's still one word out there that even Eminem won't say.\nDespite the album's artistry and massive success, in a weird way, it's hard to call it an \"influential\" album. Sure, there are lots of white rappers today and Em certainly inspired part of that, but all of them shy away from Em comparisons. And none of them\u2014stylistically, musically, and definitely lyrically\u2014can hold a candle to Eminem at his peak. Really, no one of any race can compare.\nBar for bar, line for line, Eminem is and always will be a rapper's rapper. But this isn't the typical \"rap\" album, it's so far removed from hip-hop's sonic center and typical subject matter. It's an Eminem album, and this is when Eminem became EMINEM. And Eminem isn't your regular rapper, not your regular pop star. He's what he's shown to be on the back cover of the album, a freak genius who likes to write raps.

This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it\u2014culminating when he performed \"Stan\" at the 2001 Grammys alongside Elton John.

He spends a lot of time lashing out at his critics, too.!!\" Lines from \"Criminal\" like \"Hate fags? The answer's yes\" are way too literal for a rapper so obsessed with weaving such an intricate web of humor and horror. And there are always lines he won't cross. One verse later he rhymes \"I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker/Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word...\" He stops there. There's still one word out there that even Eminem won't say.\nDespite the album's artistry and massive success, in a weird way, it's hard to call it an \"influential\" album. Sure, there are lots of white rappers today and Em certainly inspired part of that, but all of them shy away from Em comparisons. And none of them\u2014stylistically, musically, and definitely lyrically\u2014can hold a candle to Eminem at his peak. Really, no one of any race can compare.\nBar for bar, line for line, Eminem is and always will be a rapper's rapper. But this isn't the typical \"rap\" album, it's so far removed from hip-hop's sonic center and typical subject matter. It's an Eminem album, and this is when Eminem became EMINEM. And Eminem isn't your regular rapper, not your regular pop star. He's what he's shown to be on the back cover of the album, a freak genius who likes to write raps. There he sits, Marshall, and he sits alone. \u2014Insanul Ahmed",

Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.\nOn Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\nIn Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\nRuf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\n\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\nRuf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions.

            "<break>Press Release\nArgos Announces Issuance of Patent Covering the Foundation for Manufacturing its HIV Immunotherapy\nDURHAM, N.C., Feb. 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Argos Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis\u00ae precision immunotherapy technology platform, today announced the issuance of U.S. patent 9,879,053, covering the strain-independent amplification of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, nucleic acid sequences for use in vaccinations.\nThe methods described in this patent form the foundation for the manufacture of AGS-004, Argos' novel, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy for HIV. AGS-004 consists of autologous dendritic cells electroporated with amplified virus RNA and CD40L RNA that are designed to stimulate T cells to attack HIV-infected cells. Because HIV has a high mutation rate, viral variants are different in each patient. The methods described in this patent are used to amplify RNA encoding the unique viral variants in an individual from a small amount of blood or infectious plasma from which the virus can be isolated. This allows the generation of immunotherapies that are matched to the unique pathogen mutations in a specific individual, thus facilitating the development of a customized immunotherapy that may be more effective at controlling or eliminating the pathogen. The claims in this patent are directed to AGS-004, methods of manufacturing AGS-004 and methods of treatment utilizing AGS-004.\nAGS-004 is currently being evaluated in an investigator sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with the latency-reversing agent vorinostat under the direction of David Margolis, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, and Director of the HIV Cure Center at the University of North Carolina. The latent viral reservoir consists of infected immune cells in which the HIV virus is dormant and therefore hidden from attack by the immune system. Largely because of the latent viral reservoir, currently available agents for the treatment of HIV, while able to limit the proliferation of the HIV virus, have not been successful in eradicating the virus and thus curing HIV. The trial is designed to test the hypothesis that boosting antiviral immunity with AGS-004 combined with a latency reversing drug to expose the virus in latently infected cells to the immune system may enable eradication of the virus.\n\"We believe that our ability to customize the immune response to patients' unique viral variants, particularly to those variants persisting in the latent viral reservoir, offers a scientifically compelling rationale for this study,\" noted Irina Tcherepanova, Ph.D., vice president of translational medicine, Argos Therapeutics.

Drawn by Gwendolyn Stegall for the NYC LGBT Historic web web Sites Project in discussion with water Colony bartender Preston Mardenborough.\nWomen\u2019s home of Detention (demolished), Greenwich Avenue between western tenth Street and Christopher Street, 1945. Thanks to the Museum regarding the City of brand new York.\nHistory\nInitially exposed as being a restaurant c. 1950, the ocean Colony had become a hangout that is lesbian at minimum 1955, whenever Ann Bannon, composer of lesbian pulp fiction, visited it with Marijane Meaker, writer of lesbian-themed fiction. Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned \u201ca recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. \u201d The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar\u2019s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a \u201cbutch-femme\u201d powerful, where in actuality the \u201cbutch, \u201d or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the \u201cman\u2019s\u201d role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex \u2013 purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. \u2013 and also the \u201cfemme, \u201d or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the \u201cwoman\u2019s\u201d role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the \u201cbutches\u201d usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the \u201cfemmes\u201d sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with \u201copposite intercourse\u201d had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the \u201cthree article\u201d rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly. Raids on homosexual pubs had been regular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but were especially violent, frequently intimately violent, at lesbian pubs. Ladies arrested in club raids had been provided for the Women\u2019s House that is nearby of (demolished), which Joan Nestle, author and co-founder regarding the Lesbian Herstory Archives, said ended up being sardonically described one of the club clients due to the fact \u201cCountry Club. \u201d\nBecause of the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been a full-time lesbian bar with three primary areas. The space that is first where in fact the primary entry at 52 Eighth Avenue had been situated (presently Art club), had the bar\u2019s just operating egress with uncovered windows, which makes it probably the most general general general public. In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club. Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia \u201cbecause they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we\u2019d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. \u201d In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\n\u201cEvery evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. \u2026 This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. \u201d\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The \u201cback space\u201d (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination.

Thanks to the Museum regarding the City of brand new York.\nHistory\nInitially exposed as being a restaurant c. 1950, the ocean Colony had become a hangout that is lesbian at minimum 1955, whenever Ann Bannon, composer of lesbian pulp fiction, visited it with Marijane Meaker, writer of lesbian-themed fiction. Overview of the restaurant through the exact same year mentioned \u201ca recently included celebration space that handles 75 individuals. \u201d The review failed to point out that the brand new room became a destination for females dancing together, an act which could get some body place in prison through the bar\u2019s presence into the 1950s and 1960s. Even though it ended up being an essential gathering spot, specifically for white working-class lesbians at that time, the ocean Colony ended up being Mafia-run and sometimes raided because of the authorities, like numerous pubs regarding the age, many famously during the Stonewall Inn.\nThe clients mostly squeeze into a \u201cbutch-femme\u201d powerful, where in actuality the \u201cbutch, \u201d or higher masculine-dressing of this pair, would simply take the \u201cman\u2019s\u201d role when you look at the relationship xhamsterlive sex \u2013 purchase drinks, lead in dancing, available doorways, etc. \u2013 and also the \u201cfemme, \u201d or even more feminine-presenting of the set, would make the \u201cwoman\u2019s\u201d role. Preston Mardenborough, a bartender in the water Colony within the 1960s, recalled that this dynamic even extended to where patrons typically congregated: into the front side room, the end that is back of bar had been where in actuality the \u201cbutches\u201d usually sat together with front side had been where in fact the \u201cfemmes\u201d sat, both gossiping concerning the other team. The butches were particularly a target of authorities brutality, as dressing in garments associated with \u201copposite intercourse\u201d had been unlawful in nyc during the time; particularly, the \u201cthree article\u201d rule claimed which you could possibly be arrested for putting on three or maybe more articles of clothes that have been typically linked to the sex which you failed to be seemingly. Raids on homosexual pubs had been regular throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but were especially violent, frequently intimately violent, at lesbian pubs. Ladies arrested in club raids had been provided for the Women\u2019s House that is nearby of (demolished), which Joan Nestle, author and co-founder regarding the Lesbian Herstory Archives, said ended up being sardonically described one of the club clients due to the fact \u201cCountry Club. \u201d\nBecause of the 1960s, the ocean Colony had been a full-time lesbian bar with three primary areas. The space that is first where in fact the primary entry at 52 Eighth Avenue had been situated (presently Art club), had the bar\u2019s just operating egress with uncovered windows, which makes it probably the most general general general public. In this space, the club ended up being in the left and tiny tables had been in the right as one stepped in; two single-stall restrooms had been behind the club. Nestle, whom frequented the ocean Colony and has now written extensively about this, recalled that just one girl ended up being permitted when you look at the restroom at the same time, a guideline that has been implemented because of the Mafia \u201cbecause they thought we had been so sexually depraved, if two of us went in we\u2019d probably have sex, and therefore could bring the vice squad. \u201d In conformity using this guideline, she noted:\n\u201cEvery evening, a brief, handsome, butch woman with toilet paper covered around her hand, possessed a task to allot us toilet paper. \u2026 This butch girl would stand at the front end regarding the line and then we each got two wraps of wc paper. \u201d\nThe room that is second50 Eighth Avenue), into the previous restaurant area, ended up being available through the trunk of this primary club and offered table solution. The \u201cback space\u201d (48 Eighth Avenue) ended up being available through this center room and ended up being in which the dancing that is illegal destination. Mardenborough recalled that whenever the authorities raided the club, which happened regular, a key will be pushed that fired up a red light in the \u201cback space. \u201d Then, he stated, \u201cEverything would freeze and folks would cost their tables and merely stay like they\u2019re having drinks. \u201d\nInspite of the raids, ladies proceeded visiting lesbian pubs.

As mobile devices are more and more targeted by attackers, it was a good idea to publish a book on this hot topic. Written by a group of people working for IBM, the book covers a broad range of topics that can be grouped in two main sections:\n- A review of problems and threats affecting mobile devices\n- Tips and procedure to protect your mobile devices\nAcross the book, the two main mobile OS are covered (iOS and Android).\nThe first part (chapters 1 to 4) covers all the security issues that we can face when using a mobile device (and this can be extended to any \u201cconnected\u201d device to be honest). Chapter 1 (\u201cLiving in a mobile world\u201c) describes how our lifes changed thanks to (our \u201cbecause of\u201c) our mobile devices. We are always connected and this makes us more vulnerable to attacks. The second chapter (\u201cUsers and Mobile Device Management\u201d) focuses on the solution and procedures that can be deployed to control mobile devices, mainly MDM solutions but also all the requirements around it: procedures, policies. Note that a \u201cMUM\u201d (\u201cMobile User Management\u201c) could also be very useful in some cases. The third chapters reviews our privacy: \u201cSmall Word, Big consequences\u201c. This is maybe the most interesting one. If you just have one chapter to propose to non-IT people, it\u2019s this one! It covered all the issues that we may face regarding our privacy with a lot of references to real cases. Different types of attacks are reviewed in the next chapter: Scams, malwares, SMS spoofing, Social engineering, Phishing, Cloud computer (yes \u2013 it\u2019s considered as a threat) and viruses.\nThen comes the second section with more defensive advices. the fifth chapter is called \u201cProtecting your mobile devices\u201c. Basically, it\u2019s an overview of all the features implemented by a classic MDM solution: Strong passwords policies, encryption, how to use good apps, remote wiping a device. I\u2019ve to mention some good tips covered like:\n- What to do in case of one of your account has been compromised?\n- How to create strong passwords? (honestly, nothing new)\n- What are the signs that a device has been compromised?\nThe next chapter looks a bit stranger to me. It covers the support and warranty of mobile phones. I don\u2019t see a direct relation with mobile security! Maybe some interesting advices can be found here if you\u2019re fighting with your mobile operator or manufacturer. The most important fact to keep in mind is the gap between a device owned by a company (owned == supported) and a personal device used in your job (\u201cBYOD\u201c). Same idea for the chapter 7 which covers the baby boomers and teens. It reviews the impact of mobile technologies on children and young adults. It also give some advices to parents who want to make mobile devices safer for their kids.\nThe last chapter covers the case when you\u2019ve been hacked. How to get your life back? \u201cYour life\u201d is not exaggerated because mobile devices contains so much personal information (contacts, emails, sms, pictures, videos, notes, \u2026). This chapter gives tips like:\n- How to make a backup?\n- Whom to contact in case of suspicious activity?\n- How to wipe? (partial vs complete)\nThen the book ended with some annexes. The first one cover IBM NotesTraveler, a email push solution for mobile devices. Irrelevant in books like this one which must remain vendor independant (the fact that the authors are working for IBM is not a valid reason). The annexes C gives a checklist of tips to protect your mobile device and the annexe D proposes a template of \u201cMobile Acceptable User Policy\u201c.\nWhat to conclude? This books contains lot of useful information but you\u2019ve to select them by yourself. If you are only a user, some chapters are worth a read. If you are an IT-guy of looking for a MDM solution, others might be interesting too. I would say: check the table of contents and follow your points of interest!\nThe books is available online here.\nProfile<break>I received a copy of a new book published by Packt publishing about mobile security.

Gisele Amantea's twenty-five year career features in a stunning new hardcover volume. Materially rich and with great attention to design and ornamentation, Amantea's installations delve into questions of history and memory, particularly as related to women. This mograph follows the evolution of Amantea's career starting with her early works that are exuberant examples of the rococokitsch style typical of her practice. These pieces demonstrate her interest at that time in the symbols of folk culture and the stereotypes usually associated with them. The second section features works from the late 1990s where the ferninist viewpoint, which could be glimpsed in the earlier work, is strongly apparent. The last section is devoted to the artist's current practice and features hitherto unseen pieces deting her preoccupation with the concept of barriers and the use that has been made of them by various cultures w and in the past.\n- Author BiographyEve-Lyne Beaudry is curator of contemporary art at the Musee d'Art de Joliette.

However I\u2019ve just come across Roxanne Millar\u2019s book \u2018The Quest for Software requirements: Probing questions to bring Non-functional requirements [NFRs] into focus\u2019.\nWhile I am still a firm believer in User Stories for the functional aspect I am aware that that getting the Non-functional aspects covered effectively is vital, but rarely mentioned in Agile circles.\nThis article refers to the Scaled methods:\n- Disciplined Agile [Ambler]\n- SAFe [SAFe].\nSAFe describes NFRs as \u201cpersistent qualities and constraints\u201d.\nMany NFRs begin their lives as \u2018Enablers\u2019 that need to be addressed. Thereafter they constrain the system and all new Backlog items going forward. [SAFe]\nMike Cohn [Cohn] believes many NFRs can fit as User stories, however, responses to his blog post present alternatives ideas.\nJan Kees Velthoven [2013 \u2013 Responding to Cohn\u2019s post] proposes an alternative format:\nAs an [actor] I must [constraint] otherwise [fact or argument]\nScott Ambler [Ambler] would call these Technical stories.\nIn reality NFRs, including architectural implementations do not fit simply into the User story model. Some relate to a single User story / other Product Backlog Item (PBI) and may be part of the acceptance criteria, some are global; however, many relate to various subsets of the User stories. These are probably the hardest to deal with. A major error is wrongly assuming an NFR is global.\nAmbler would record those which are not stories or Acceptance criteria items in a list for developers and testers to manage. In this he is following the RUP concept of \u2018Supplementary Requirements\u2019 listing all NFRs.\nSome NFRs, once delivered, can be added to the Definition of done so that subsequent User stories conform to them. SAFe extends this concept to iterations, program increments and Releases. It defines it in the \u2018SAFe Requirements model\u2019 presenting a highly structured set of relationships between Backlog items, NFRs and System qualities tests.\nSurprisingly, in her book, Millar ignores Tom Gilb\u2019s Planguage, see [Gilb], (developed over decades) which offers an excellent way of approaching metrics for NFRs, replacing the more common vague statements which stakeholders generally offer. Although SAFe states that when specifying NFRs they should be Bounded; Negotiable; Independent and Testable it fails to suggest any further level of definition of individual NFRs, at least in the material referenced below. However, it does point out that a small increment to an NFR may have a dramatic cost implication, don\u2019t just let stakeholders assume linearity. Uptime is a good example \u2013 see [SAFe].\nGilb says:\n\u201c\u2026it is essential that the explicit notion of quantification be added to agile concepts\u201d. \u201cQuality is Scalar, hence variable and measurable\u201d.\nUser stories commence life as Epics and are then further defined as they get nearer to implementation. Is this approach appropriate for NFRs too? Most NFRs can be defined with a range however this goal does not generally need to be achieved in the early stages. In the Agile world we benefit from learning and adapting as we go along, consequently NFRs should be adjusted accordingly.\nAfter defining, the NFRs need to be valued \u2013 See Shopping cart mentality in FURPS+ article [IBM].\nIs it necessary to define the NFRs upfront?\nThere are some reasons why this could be of value:\nGabrielle Benefield and Susan Atkinson find Gilb\u2019s Planguage valuable in defining Agile contracts where payment should be staged and based on Business Value delivered. Adam Russell [Responding to Cohn in 2011] points out that NFRs should be identified in Business cases so that the Business can decide whether, say, a 5% increase in an NFR is actually worth the cost.\nRussell believes NFRs should always be expressed upfront:\nto start the process of focusing your attention on what qualities are valued in your target user population, and developing the team vocabulary to describe and analyse them\nA lot of effort could be expended on managing NFRs, however the effort should relate to the value delivered. Hence an NFR which goes up exponentially in cost as the scale is increased is worthy of a fair amount of effort!\nAs with Functional requirements, NFRs are not completely visible at the start of a project so a framework such as FURPS+ [IBM] can be useful in scanning for them.\nFrom an Agile perspective, I would recommend that both NFRs and their metrics are regularly reviewed during planning sessions as, inevitably, more becomes known.\nThe delivery Roadmap needs to incorporate the NFRs showing at what point each is expected to be implemented unless it is recorded as a PBI. With the Roadmap displayed on the wall everyone should be aware of the situation and it should be reviewed in each planning session. This is probably the best way of handling Ambler\u2019s recommendation of using the Lean principle of Deferring commitment\nConclusion\nMy conclusion is that those of us in the Agile world needs to take Non-Functional Requirements much more seriously if we want to deliver Agile effectively.\nReferences:\n- [Ambler] Strategies for Implementing Non-Functional Requirements\n- [Benefield] Lean Agile Legal Contracts for outsourcing \u2013 Gabrielle Benefield\n- [Cohn] Non-functional Requirements as User Stories\n- [Gilb] What\u2019s Wrong With Agile Methods \u2013Some Principles and Values to Encourage Quantification \u2013 Gilb & Brodie 2007\n- [IBM] Capturing Architectural Requirements IBM 2005\n- [SAFe] Nonfunctional Requirements Abstract<break>Non-Functional Requirements in an Agile World\nAs an Agile enthusiast I\u2019ve always rejected \u2018Requirements\u2019 as being old-school and contrary to the Agile way.

            "<break>Most of us have had moments when we think we are fairly unique; the main character of life\u2019s story if you will. I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock\u2019s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don\u2019t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you\u2019re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us.

Be it their association for complete album like Naanum Rowdy Dhaan or other tracks where Vignesh Benz the lyrics, it's been a great delight to the listeners for the packaging of fascination they deliver. Now the duo is back with their latest outing ' Thaana Serndha Kootam' featuring Suriya and Keerthy Suresh in lead roles. K.E.

The lyrics has purity with a peak of playfulness boy's perspective. In fact the song has already been a favourite of town people from the time it was launched as a single track. There is a lot of energy in the song right on the first second and the musical components or so much invigorating to the senses.

The song has highly enthusiastic appeal from musical team. On a precise note, this happens to be the first ever fast paced folk song for Suriya in the recent times. The high level energy pumping percussion and unparalleled rendition by Antony Dasan makes the song more enjoyable. Not to miss the interludes that comes with fast running notes on Veena, which is exotically unparalleled.\nThaana Serndha Koottam\nSingers: Anirudh and Vignesh Shivn\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nThe song has lots of values on the lyrical part and it looks like this would be placed during a crucial moment of the movie.

        "reference": "Most of us have had moments when we think we are fairly unique; the main character of life\u2019s story if you will. I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock\u2019s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don\u2019t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you\u2019re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us.

        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "<break>In 1971, NASA sent three astronauts who were University alumni to the moon as part of the Apollo 15 lunar mission. Now, three University professors have been chosen for a new NASA project, one that believes many answers may be blowing in the wind.\nOn Monday, NASA announced that a team of Michigan University professors - Christopher Ruf, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences and electrical engineering and computer sciences; Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\nIn Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\nRuf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\n\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\nRuf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.<break>In 1971, NASA sent three astronauts who were University alumni to the moon as part of the Apollo 15 lunar mission.

Aaron Ridley, associate professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences; and Derek Posselt, assistant professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences - were chosen to receive $151.7 million over the next five years to undertake their Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System project.\nThe project aims to simultaneously launch eight satellites by 2016 that will spend at least two years in space where they will gather data about cyclones and other tropical storms that previous technology found difficult to provide because of the difficulty of studying inside oceanic storms.\nThe team of professors beat out 18 other teams that submitted proposals when the agency offered an opportunity for funds for small spaceflight investigations in Earth's system, made possible by the Earth Venture-class series of projects in NASA's Earth Science Division.\nThe University professors will partner with Southwest Research Institute of Texas, Surrey Satellite Technology of Colorado and the NASA Ames Research Center to build the satellites and gather data that can be used for research.\nIn Earth's orbit, the satellites' functions will include probing the interaction between seawater and air and how that interaction has a role in the development of hurricanes and other tropical storms.\nRuf, the project's principal investigator, said the satellites will be up in space to monitor hurricanes for at least two hurricane seasons but noted that while the satellites are designed for a two-year lifetime, they may last longer.\n\"The first one is like a training session, to make sure everything is working and tune up all of the electronics properly, and then the second year we'll be able to really do it,\" Ruf said.\nRuf said their mission was attractive to NASA because their satellites are smaller and less expensive than previous satellites.\n\"There's several different ways of looking at the surface conditions that have been flying since the 1970s, and the more traditional ways are much bigger and much more expensive,\" he said.\nRuf added that the satellites' technology will allow for a mission that will be the first of its kind.\n\"As far as using this kind of technology specifically, it's been demonstrated twice before on satellites, but they were just these little demonstrations, things that only lasted for a few weeks to show that the idea was sound,\" Ruf said. \"But there was never like a full, concerted mission to do sustained science.\"\nRuf said the team also extensively researched cyclones before submitting the proposal.\n\"We did a lot of historical analysis ... as part of the design study for how many satellites we would need and the detail about their design so we would be able to see a lot of hurricanes,\" Ruf said.\nThe mission will focus on taking measurements of hurricanes during the hurricanes, which hasn't been done before, according to Ruf.\n\"(Old satellites) stopped working well as soon as you get close to the middle of the hurricane because there is too much rain, and this new technique can see right through the rain well, so that's a big-deal thing,\" Ruf said.\nRuf added that studying such hard-to-reach areas of the storms can help meteorologists better forecast the intensity of hurricanes in the future.\nPosselt said he joined the project to further investigate convection as a general topic, rather than solely tropical cyclones.\n\"My task on this is ... to explore uses of this data to try to understand tropical precipitation,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that smaller storms are important to study as well.\n\"In the last five or 10 years or so, there's been a more concerted effort to try to understand these tropical systems, partly because they can give rise to hurricanes down the road if they persist long enough and organize in the right way,\" Posselt said.\nPosselt added that NASA saw how their proposal would benefit science without an exorbitant cost.\n\"So for NASA, I think this probably fell in a bit of a sweet spot ... it's a measurement that we don't have globally but it's using technology that we don't have to spend tens of millions of dollars developing,\" Posselt said.\nNASA spokesman Steve Cole said this mission will provide NASA with the kind of cutting-edge study of Earth they look for.\n\"NASA does a lot of research into developing for new ways to use the vantage point of space, having instruments in space to study weather, hurricanes, all sorts of earth science,\" Cole said. \"We've had a number of missions that study winds ... and this mission is kind of pushing the envelope.\"\nCole added that it is somewhat unique for NASA to have a university-led mission.\n\"Most NASA missions are done not at universities, but we do have a history in a wide range of sciences of what we call P.I.-led missions. We have them in planet science and solar science,\" Cole said.<break>CHI 2010 Workshop May 7 or 8, 2011 (final date to be announced)\nCall for Participation\nLarge interactive displays are now common in public urban life. Museums, libraries, public plazas, and architectural facades already take advantage of interactive technologies for visual and interactive information presentation. Researchers and practitioners from such varied disciplines as art, architecture, design, HCI, and media theory have started to explore the potential and impact of large display installations in public urban settings.\nThis workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from different disciplines such as art, architecture, design, HCI, social sciences, and media theory to exchange insights on current research questions in the area. The workshop will focus on to the following topics: how to design large interactive display installations that promote engaging experiences and go beyond playful interaction, how different interaction models shape people\u2019s experience in urban spaces, and how to evaluate their impact.\nWorkshop Goals & Topics\nThe goal of this one-day CHI 2011 workshop is to cross-fertilize insights from different disciplines, to establish a more general understanding of large interactive displays in public urban contexts, and to develop an agenda for future research directions in this area. Rather than focusing on paper presentations, this workshop aims to trigger active and dynamic group discussions around the following topics:\nBeyond Playful Interaction\nA number of studies found that large display installations invite for playful interaction but often fail to convey meaningful experiences related to content. This raises the following questions:\n- How can we design installations that endure people\u2019s attention past the initial novelty effect and direct the interest toward the content?\n- What design strategies can be applied to promote an active individual and social exploration and discussion of the presented information?\nA number of interaction techniques have been explored for large displays in public spaces ranging from interaction via cell phones, to direct-touch or full body interaction. We would like to discuss:\n- How do different interaction methods shape people\u2019s experience of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How do interaction methods differ from each other in terms of triggering interaction and engagement with the presented content?\nDifferent quantitative and qualitative methods have been applied to evaluate people\u2019s experience and use of large display installations in public spaces. During the workshop we would like to discuss:\n- How can we evaluate the \"success\" of large display installations in urban spaces?\n- How can particular aspects of public large display installations such as engagement be evaluated?\n- What kind of evaluation methods are most effective in different progress stages (design phase/installment phase)?\nFor more details on the workshop please refer to our extended abstract and workshop proposal.\nSubmission Details\nSubmit a position paper (maximum 4 pages) to largedisplaysinurbanlife@gmail.com by January 14, 2011 using the CHI extended abstract format. The paper should describe experiences, works in progress, or theories around designing and/or evaluating large interactive displays in public urban settings.

I was having one of these moments on Friday night when I approached the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto for a screening of Hitchcock\u2019s classic Dial M for Murder. Surely I would be one of only a handful of cinephiles out on Friday night to catch a movie that is over 50 years old. This attitude was largely responsible for the shock I experienced when I had to scramble to find a seat. The screening must of have been sold out! Perhaps more surprising to me was the variety of people in the audience. Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don\u2019t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you\u2019re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us. Let the Master of Suspense show you how the old-school use to do it, before the Hollywood thriller became formulaic.

Couples were on dates, a mother and her two teenage daughters laughed and gabbed as they found some front row seats, small packs of university students congregated at the back, and an elderly woman asked me to save her a seat in case her expedition towards the centre of the row proved fruitless. The audience was devoid of pretension and snobbery, these people were here to be entertained, and I realized, as I shed my own pretensions, so was I.\nI should mention that the TIFF Bell Lightbox is an amazing movie theatre. The seats are spacious and comfortable, while the cup-holders are ingenious, as they are in front of and below the armrest and completely out of the way, while still easily accessible. Also, the four screenings that I have seen have started promptly, without commercials or previews; kind of a nice change of pace considering that previews are easily accessible online these days.\nDial M for Murder went off without a Hitch, if you don\u2019t count its director. Grace Kelly was still beautiful as the delicate Margot Wendice, Ray Milland has retained his charismatically cloaked deviousness as Tony Wendice, who is in the market for a murdered wife, and my second time watching the film has given me a huge appreciation for the very humorous performance by John Williams as the infallible Chief Inspector Hubbard.\nThe strengths of Dial M for the Murder, and the reasons why it is a classic, are the strong performances by the cast, the intelligent screenplay from Frederick Knott (based on his play of the same name), and of course, the Master of Suspense behind the camera. Rarely do plays adapted for the screen work as well as this one. The quality of Dial M for Murder is in the same league as Sleuth (1972), which is high praise from me considering Sleuth is by far my favourite film of all-time.\nI have trouble expressing how wonderful and fortunate Torontonians are to have a theatre like the Lightbox that is willing to screen Hitchcock classics, on actual film no less. If you grew up with Hitchcock films and want to feel nostalgic, or if you\u2019re younger and are feeling adventurous, I urge you to get down to the Lightbox in November or December as there are some amazing Hitchock screenings ahead of us. Let the Master of Suspense show you how the old-school use to do it, before the Hollywood thriller became formulaic.

        "reference": "It's always ready like to hear something that comes in combination Vignesh Shivan and Anirudh. Be it their association for complete album like Naanum Rowdy Dhaan or other tracks where Vignesh Benz the lyrics, it's been a great delight to the listeners for the packaging of fascination they deliver. Now the duo is back with their latest outing ' Thaana Serndha Kootam' featuring Suriya and Keerthy Suresh in lead roles. K.E. Gnanavel Raja studio Green films bankrolled this movie, which happens to be a remake of superhit Hindi movie Special 26. The album has 5 songs based on different genres.\nNaana Thana\nSingers: Anirudh\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nIt's a complete song that takes you through the exciting phase of of moments in love. The lyrics has purity with a peak of playfulness boy's perspective. In fact the song has already been a favourite of town people from the time it was launched as a single track. There is a lot of energy in the song right on the first second and the musical components or so much invigorating to the senses. Anirudh has picked the style of that Hindi stage performance where the fill-ins with harmonium and vocalism are evident.\nSodakku\nSingers: Antony Dasan\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nThe song needs no introduction as it has already through to be a strong winner in the charts. The song has highly enthusiastic appeal from musical team. On a precise note, this happens to be the first ever fast paced folk song for Suriya in the recent times. The high level energy pumping percussion and unparalleled rendition by Antony Dasan makes the song more enjoyable. Not to miss the interludes that comes with fast running notes on Veena, which is exotically unparalleled.\nThaana Serndha Koottam\nSingers: Anirudh and Vignesh Shivn\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nThe song has lots of values on the lyrical part and it looks like this would be placed during a crucial moment of the movie. The distorted guitar on the backdrops along with the rhythmic accompaniment add more sense to the peppiness. The kind of rendition by both Anirudh and Vignesh belong to a unique panache. This could get more prominence with the visual presentation of the song.\nEngae Endru Povadhu\nSingers: Anirudh and Shakthishree Gopalan\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nThere are certain times, where a particular song manages to get beyond the premise of a movie and touch us unconditionally. It is decided by the theme of the song, the lyrical Phrases and of course the musical presentation that would imbibe to our senses. This song brings out such traits in a great way that the song instantly appeals to our attention. The lyrical lines are so much simple and yet compelling that was down a lot of emotions. Anirudh has always been a master of such musical style and it just enables the song to get propelled to a greater stroke.\nPeela Peela\nSingers: Jassie Gift, Nakash Aziz and Mali\nLyrics: Vignesh Shivn\nInnovative lyrics and fun filled music makes the song click well at the very initial level you start listening to it. As known to many, TSK is set in the time period of 80s and henceforth, the lyrical words used in the song that includes Ujala, Rasna and few more terms that were prominent during those times gets us connected easily.\nOn the whole, Thaana Serndha Koottam delivers a decent package of music that will definitely be the best in the careers of Suriya, Vignesh Shivn and Anirudh respectively. The songs have the best feel of high energy, emotions, fun, joy and everything that it needs to impress listeners.\nVerdict : Suriya-Anirudh-Vignesh Shivn trio sparkle in this Chartbuster with great music.\n#ThaanaSerndhaKoottam #VigneshShivn #Suriya #KeerthySuresh #studioGreen #Anirudh #ThaanaSerndhaKoottamMusicReview\nHowever been one of the top heroines in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, Keerthy Suresh has been well...\nDirected by \u2018Uriyadi\u2019 fame Director Vijay Kumar and bankrolled by himself under the banner of...\nProduced under the grand banner of \u2018Lyca Productions\u2019, the shooting of K V Anand\u2019s directorial...",

Currently, the agro-allied industry (in primary processing) accounts for nearly half of all economic the activity in sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the continent spends $30bn to $50bn each year importing food and still has significant food risk and nutritional deficiencies in many parts of the region.

Africa is importing what it should be producing, creating poverty within the region and consequently creating jobs for the people in other continents while its people lack opportunities.\nIt is interesting to note that African countries import numerous agricultural products which are also, ironically, produced locally. The rise of imports for these Agricultural products has been attributed to the inability to produce enough to satisfy growing local demand, due to low yields and relatively low levels of productivity. Furthermore, over 80% of Africa\u2019s agricultural products are being produced by smallholder farmers who produce 70% of the continent\u2019s food supply, according to FAO.\nTaking a look at Agricultural exports, one discovers that African countries mainly export cocoa, edible fruit and nuts, coffee and tea and vegetables to the rest of the world. The main agricultural importing countries of the African export are the United States, China, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nAfrican countries do not feature under the top supplying countries for any of these markets. If Africa is serious about changing from agricultural product importers, then addressing the following issues are of paramount importance: innovation in production technology, the cost of inputs (energy and fertilisers), management of changes in climatic conditions (e.g. access to water through irrigation), knowledge transfer and capacity building, investment in agriculture and agriculture-related infrastructure (credit facilities, transportation networks, cold-storage facilities and communication networks) and access to information.\nALSO READ: Questions on Nigeria\u2019s 2017 Budget\nGovernments and leaders in Africa (past and present) should (have) know(n) in importing food is a serious minus for the leadership of the component countries in Africa.\nAgriculture is also a major component for Africa becoming an industrialised continent, in the sense that its raw materials are needed in production of other commodities.
