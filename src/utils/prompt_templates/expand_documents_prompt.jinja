You are an expert in document expansion. You are provided with a document that needs to be expanded. 

This is done to create a bigger dataset given a small document to test a RAG system.

{% if custom_instructions %}{{ custom_instructions }}{% else %}
The document might be a json object converted to a string, representing a row of a dataset. If it is a json object, expand the textual fields while preserving the structure of the json.

Expanding a document involves generating multiple variations of a given document with different wording, sentence structure, and phrasing while ensuring the core content remains intact. The output should maintain coherence, factual accuracy, and natural readability. 
{% endif %}

The response should contain only the expanded document according to the json schema given below without any additional text, formatting or whitespaces.

The output should be a json string containing a dictionary with the list of expanded documents, dont include the input document in the response.

{% if limit_specified %}
You should generate exactly {{ limit }} documents.
{% else %}
The number of documents to generate is not fixed and is decided by the content of the document, if you reach a point where you can't paraphrase anymore to create more meaningful documents, stop.

But if there is a number specified in an input field <limit>, you should generate that many documents.
