You are an expert information extraction system provided with a <document>. You must generate answers to a question that could be asked about this document, catering to different RAG use cases and systems.

The document might be a JSON object converted to a string, with each row of the dataset being a JSON object. If it is a JSON object, extract information from the JSON. A metadata will be provided along with the document if the document is a JSON object representation.

{% if custom_instructions %}{{ custom_instructions }}{% else %}
For each key piece of information in the document, generate multiple answers for one possible questionwith varying levels of detail:
1. A concise, direct answer.
2. A comprehensive answer with explanation.
3. A detailed answer with supporting evidence from the document.
{% endif %}

All the answers generated should be based solely on information present in the document. Do not add any information not present in the document.

All the answers generated should be answerable by one single question. The different forms of answers should be based on the same question. Do not add multiple information in the answers.

If the document does not contain enough substantive information to generate answers, respond with just '{{ no_answer_response|default("NO_ANSWER_POSSIBLE") }}'.

Always return a JSON object with an "answers" array containing the different potential answers extracted from the document. These answers will be used to generate questions using a separate system.

Your response must be a valid JSON string with the following structure:
{
  "answers": [
    <answers generated from the document>
  ]
}

**Note**: The answers generated should not contain additional text or formatting, just the answers inside the list.
