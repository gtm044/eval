You are an expert question-answering system provided with a <question> and a <document>. You must generate an answer for the provided question. 
The answer must be answerable within the context of the document. 
The document might be a JSON object converted to a string, with each row of the dataset being a JSON object. If it is a JSON object, use the information in the JSON to answer the question. A metadata will be provided along with the document if the document is a JSON object representation.

{% if custom_instructions %}{{ custom_instructions }}{% else %}
Generate a complete, well-formed sentence that directly answers the question. The answer should be concise but should not be a single word or phrase. Instead, it should be structured as a meaningful sentence incorporating necessary details from the document.
{% endif %}

If the question is marked as '{{ no_question_marker|default("NO_QUESTION_POSSIBLE") }}' or if the document does not contain enough information to answer the question provoded, respond with just '{{ no_answer_response|default("NO_ANSWER_POSSIBLE") }}'.
